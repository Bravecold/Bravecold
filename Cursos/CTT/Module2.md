Let's dive right into the MTA domains of understanding for the seat plus and this is the document that

I just instructed you to download from Komp Teabag called the MTA CTT plus certification of exam objectives.

And if you come down here to page three, you will see the weight at each domain of understanding receives

on the exam.

So all of them are at about 15 percent except for group facilitation domain four.

So I tell you that just to make sure that in your preparation, you know where to focus your efforts,

of course, you want to be prepared for all of these domains, but group facilitation is specifically

heavy on the evaluation.

So you want to make sure that you're thoroughly prepared for that domain.

One is broken into two sub domains, so domain one is planning prior to the course.

So this is everything that goes into developing a course, not only the course creation, but also how

you plan as an instructor to facilitate a course appropriately.

So subdomain one A is review learning objections and match them to learner and organization needs.

So this is about the purpose of your class, how to identify why you're being asked to teach it and

what the learners really need to know, and then how to build a course around that.

The second subdomain is create an environment conducive to learning.

This has to do with classroom logistics, everything from the temperature of the room and how to handle

miscellaneous cables to technical devices to seating charts and things like that.

Domain two is methods and media for instructional delivery, so this has to do with, again, methods

of delivery, so different techniques for speaking to a class and teaching and also media.

So presentation styles, different resources, technologies and tools to present, you know, learning

concepts so the subdomains to a select and implement delivery methods.

So you're going to be talking a little bit about delivering instruction, different kinds of learning

theories, different kinds of learners, and how to apply different methods of instruction given the

learning types.

So that's a very interesting section.

And then also use of instructional media.

You know, how do you use slideshows correctly?

How do you use video and graphics?

Also in the virtual platform?

What online tools are virtual tools can you use in your classroom to make them engaging for the learner?

You'll talk about that.

They're the third domain is instructor credibility and communications.

So this is all about how to assert yourself confidently in the classroom and really how to command yourself.

So this is broken up into the subdomains, demonstrate professional conduct and content expertise,

how to make sure you know what you're talking about, what to do if you're caught not knowing something

about a technical concept.

Also, professional conduct, what you look like, how you hold yourself, posture, poise three B is

use communication and presentation skills to facilitate learning.

So this is where we talk about all communication and public speaking, how to use gestures, facial

expressions, how to make sure that our our speech is not offensive to anybody, things like that.

And then here's the big one group facilitation.

So in for a establish and maintain a learner centered environment.

So how do you make sure that this isn't all about you as the instructor or all about the organization,

but how to really make sure that all of your teaching practices focus on the individual learner and

with their goals and with their purposes in mind and their motivations in mind, use a variety of question

types and techniques.

So how to use different forms of questions to engage listeners and to create certain types of outcomes

in a classroom?

There's a number of questions about that on the exam.

Forese address learner needs for additional explanation and encouragement.

What to do when a student doesn't understand completely when they look lost, when somebody lags behind,

when they lack motivation or get interested, and then for demotivate and reinforce learners.

So again, this has to do with motivation, following up after the class, things like that.

In domain five, we have evaluating the training event.

Five is evaluate learner performance throughout the training event, how to develop quizzes and assessments,

when to give them what types of assessments you can use and when they're appropriate.

And five B, evaluate Trayner performance and delivery, of course.

This is where you are reflective and you look at your own performance and your own course design to

see how it worked, what you would improve next time, how to communicate that to the training organization.

So those are the domains.

We're going to dive deep into these, break them down, make sure that we've hit on all of the topics

under discussion.

But I wanted you to have an overall view of what we're going to be talking about in this course.


!-------------------------------------------

The moment of truth with technical training is when you're standing in front of an audience, when you're

standing in front of your classroom.

These are your peers.

These are adults.

These are knowledgeable, intelligent people already.

And you want to make sure that you're prepared well to give something substantive and also so that you

can deliver with confidence.

And he's preparation prior to the course includes all these things.

And the more prepared you are, the better the class you're going to give.

So we don't just rest on our existing knowledge of the technical concept, but we give the appropriate

attention to course development and classroom logistics to make sure that everything goes smoothly when

we actually deliver the class.

So domain one, we talk about how to develop a course, how to speak to an organization to find out

why they're even doing the course, how to figure out what learners already know so that you understand

what the knowledge gaps are.

We also talk about a couple of frameworks for developing classes to make sure that they're thorough

and really fleshed out before you deliver the class.

We also talk about classroom environment creation, how to set up the seats, how to set the temperature,

how to avoid disasters with technology.

All of that is in domain one.

So that's what you have to look forward to.

And let's make sure that we plan our course correctly.

!-------------------------------------------

Transcript
So before you can even begin developing a curriculum or planning for training, you really need to be

able to answer the question, why are we doing this training at all?

What are the needs that are going to be filled by this training?

And in order to answer that question, you need to draw information from two sources.

Number one, the organization offering the training and number to the learners that will be trained.

So first of all, what need of the organization are we hoping to fill by offering this training?

And second, what do the learners need to know so that they can, you know, change their behavior and

be more effective in the future?

So organizations can offer training for a number of different reasons.

Perhaps you're working with a technology academy and they offer programs as their main source of income.

So they're marketing training programs for people who are interested in getting started in it and trying

to get technical certifications.

So that's one possible need.

But intro organizationally, it could be a matter of training employees.

There could be some negligence on the part of the employee.

There could be some increased efficiency that could be accomplished if employees had greater skills.

But organizations often need to understand what the return on investment is.

So if I'm spending money on training, I'm paying you, I'm paying the materials, I'm taking time away

from productivity.

For people to be trained, organizations need to understand clearly what they're getting back as a return

on that investment.

But these organizational needs can be varied.

So just as a personal story, I worked with a training organization who was contracting with a federal

agency, and this federal agency realized that some of their I.T. employees were not taking care of

important tasks that affected the overall risk posture of the organization.

And this had to do with compliance with federal regulations for risk assurance.

And so they really needed to train their employees so that they felt competent enough to do these risk

related tasks and so that the agency could remain in compliance.

So that was their specific need that we had to take in mind as we were developing the course.

Second, we have learner needs, so it's good to know what skills the employees already have or what

skills the learners already have and then what they need to know so that you can fill in the gap with

the training.

What skills, knowledge, abilities do they need so that they can reach their goals?

OK, so organisational needs, in order to gather this information, you're going to need stakeholder

input, so you'll need to speak with executives perhaps who have their finger on the pulse of the organization.

It could be H.R. department hiring staff is very aware of the skills that they're not finding new recruits

and that they might need to train internally.

And it could also be managers and team members.

Right.

So they're on the ground doing the work.

Managers are very well aware that their team members don't have a certain skill and maybe even team

members say, you know, hey, we don't have anyone on our team that knows how to do this or that.

And that's why we need this training, needed skills for identifying gaps and understanding.

You're trying to enhance competencies that are already existing so you can increase productivity or

efficiency.

And again, it could be emerging or future technologies that need to be trained.

And again, we want to make this specific, especially if you're working in an organization that's training

employees, make it specific to their day to day job.

So what will they be able to take from the training and apply to make them a better employee in their

current job role?

And for this reason, you can't be too broad, but you have to really dial it into some specific outcomes

that you're looking for.

So, again, this is not just knowledge, but also application.

And the difference is that knowledge is kind of informational.

It's conceptual, it's about memorizing information or understanding a topic.

But application has to do with an actual technical ability that you are hoping that these students will

leave your course with.

And this will be specific to the learner itself and their and their different job roles.

Once you've had these conversations, you've sat with organizational stakeholders, you've sat with

learners and you've figured out where the gaps are and you know how to address these needs.

You will be able to clearly define and articulate the learning outcome for the course and the learning

outcome and instructional goal, which is a high level objective of the course itself.

And here's an example of one client relations management software training employees will learn CRM

functionality for creating email templates, organizing a sales pipeline and integrating social media

platforms.

So it's clear what the training is.

It's about this CRM software and it's clear what the instructional outcomes are going to be.

They'll know how to create email templates, organize sales pipelines and integrate social media platforms.

So that's the goal after this conversation, after you've addressed needs to be able to clearly articulate

your instructional goals.

!-------------------------------------------

Transcript
After you've identified the organizational and learner needs for the course and you've been able to

clearly define that high level instructional goal or purpose of the class, the next step is to hone

it down into specific learning objectives.

And the learning objectives are knowledge, skills and abilities that the learner is expected to acquire

by the end of the course.

And there's a development process for how to come up with these learning objectives.

And it's in three steps.

We're going to talk about them now.

Step number one, you take that high level instructional goal, which we talked about in the previous

lesson, and then from that overarching goal, you then create a topical outline which divides the instruction

goal into units or domains of understanding.

And then from those topical units, you then create specific learning objectives, which are the actual

tactical skills, technical skills and abilities that the learner will leave with.

And these are important to be able to clearly define not only for the students, but also when communicating

with the organization that's hosting the training or technical trainers that will be teaching a course

that you develop.

It's very important to make all of this clear because it guides a well course.

So here we are with the instructional goal that we had from our previous lecture, the client relations

management software training.

Right.

We had that high level overview, as well as just three main topics of understanding that would be accomplished,

that is creating email templates, organizing sales pipelines and integrating social media.

So the next thing to do would be to create a topical outline based on that high level instructional

goal.

So here's the instructional goal again.

And now it's been broken down.

So there's three high level tasks have now been created into units, unit one about creating emails,

unit two about organizing sales pipelines, and Unit three about integrating social media.

And then there are sub units in each one of those topical units that kind of break it down even further.

So when it comes to creating email templates, for example, synchronizing with the CRM, creating a

template design, inserting text into the template, this is breaking down the topics even further.

And then the final step is to define the learning objectives, which are specific learning outcomes

that are based on each topical unit that you created in the earlier step.

So this is just breaking down one unit, just unit one about creating email templates.

And you'll notice that the subtasks that we developed previously, namely synchronising email, choosing

template design and inserting template text, have now been divided down even further to the specific

technical tasks that the learner will learn how to do.

They'll learn how to locate the email template tab in the software.

They'll learn how to input their email account credentials as they're sinking the email with the CRM.

And then they'll also learn how to allow the CRM to access email contact.

So this is this is mind at the minut level, each specific task.

But now this is very clear to anybody that's training the course or anybody that's hosting the course

as to what the students will learn, what they'll come out being able to do at the end of the technical

training.

!-------------------------------------------
Transcript
As you're developing your course, you do need to take into consideration what your learners already

know, you'll need to assess their current skill level so that you can design the course accordingly.

For example, you may find that students are well versed in the topic and it doesn't need to be included

in the training at all.

Or maybe you just do a brief review.

On the other hand, if you identify particular weaknesses, then you may choose to allocate more time

in the class for practicing the technical skill or for opening yourself up to questions and answers,

something like that.

So assess first what your learner already knows.

Don't make assumptions as to what they already know.

It could be that, you know, if you assume that your student doesn't know anything, that you end up

creating a course that is overly simplistic and then it seems like a waste of time for the learner.

On the other hand, if you make your course too complicated, assume that your learner knows a lot already.

Then it can be very frustrating to the student and it can be very difficult for that that matter.

So there's a sweet spot there for creating a course that's going to really fit the needs.

So how do you determine, you know, what your students already know?

You could create a form of assessment, some sort of written form maybe where they self reflect and

write down what they'd like to learn and their strengths and weaknesses.

Or it could just be conversations that you have, as we mentioned before, with stakeholders, managers,

team members to get a sense of of what really needs to be targeted in the course.

And you may determine that some hard and fast core prerequisites are required.

So this is the case, particularly in academies of technology.

I worked with one academy and we offered some higher level cybersecurity certification training programs,

but we didn't really like to put students in those who didn't have a basic understanding of technology,

hardware, software, basic networking.

So sometimes we'd suggest and even require that a student have past come to a plus before they were

in the company of security plus course.

So that might be the case in your training organization or with an internal training course, you may

require that there's some baseline knowledge and experience that each learner has before they're invited

to the course.

Let's took it.

Take a look at some ways to do pre course assessments, some considerations here.

First of all, we all know what it's like to be in a corporate atmosphere.

It can be very competitive.

People don't often like to admit to the things that they don't know because they think that it'll put

them at a competitive disadvantage.

This isn't very conducive to education, but we got to work with what we what we've got.

So create an atmosphere of of ease and trust, follow organizational protocols and be respectful and

confidential.

So, you know, obviously, if employees open up about things that they don't know that they can use,

brushing up on, you know, be respectful of the competitive environment that they're part of.

Another way of assessing skill level is to do a formal test.

So this is a multiple choice or perhaps a long answer test where you ask questions that will identify

what students know and what they don't know.

And the purpose is not to trick anybody up or make the questions too hard, but to assess learning.

So as you're developing the questions, you want to keep that in your mind.

That's the purpose of the pre course exam.

!-------------------------------------------

Transcript
The ATI methodology for instructional design is a commonly used life-cycle process for how to go about

building a curriculum for a technical program, Addae by name is not called out in the plus exam, but

a lot of the principles and fundamental concepts that are covered in ADDAE methodology do appear on

the test.

So it will be important that you understand those and really it does help you to create good curriculum.

So as a technical trainer, you want to be familiar with the five steps of the ADDAE model.

Addae is an acronym for the Five Steps Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation.

So let's talk about these steps one by one and how they contribute to designing an effective technical

training course.

The first step in the ADDAE model is the analysis that we've talked about.

Some of this already assessing organizational needs, assessing learner needs, assessing current skill

level of your learners.

But it's also good to ask yourself, you know, if this course is successful, what does success look

like at the end of it?

What is going to make us feel like it really accomplished its goals?

And then how will that be measured to by the organization or the individual receiving the training?

That's part of the analysis phase.

Also, there'll be an analysis of the actual technical skills and tasks.

What is the change of behavior that we're looking to accomplish in the learner?

What technologies will they be using?

How will it impact their day to day life?

And how will workflow be improved by the technical skills that you're teaching?

And then also a performance analysis.

So this has, again, to do with the needs of the organization.

But how will the improved learner abilities affect the organization?

How will it optimize their process again?

And what will this mean for a return on investment for the training organization or excuse me, for

the organization that the workers will be part of in the design phase when you're actually designing

the course content?

There are some considerations to keep in mind.

First of all, is it cost effective?

So what is your budget for creating the course?

You know, this will help you to know what kind of technologies you can use, what kind of materials

you have at your disposal when it comes to cost considerations, too.

If you are training employees that are being pulled away from their nine to five jobs, you have to

really be clear to the organization as to what the cost will be in terms of man hours and how that will

impact workflow within the organization.

So that's to be considered when you're designing your course.

Of course, you want your training to be effective, specifically based on the learning objectives that

we talked about developing.

And again, we wanted to be practical and to the day to day work of the learners.

And when it comes to making a course effective, you also need to understand the qualifications that

you will require for a trainer.

So what level of expertise is required on the trainers part?

So when you're sourcing a trainer for your course, you know, what do they need to know and what kind

of experience they need to have?

That's part of the design process, too.

And then how will you make your course engaging.

So focusing on learner benefits, learner, focus, learner focused education, captivating to your

audience, full of interesting and exciting activities and things like that.

So this will be considered in the design phase.

And once you designed it, now you have to develop it.

So a lot of times when it comes to development, you will create first a prototype.

So this is kind of like a brief demonstration of the core style.

You will discuss what kind of activities give some samples, also a summary of the course and a plan

of how it will be implemented.

This is usually to communicate it with organizational leadership.

So they're aware of what the course is going to look like when it's fully developed.

Then you'll have to actually develop the content itself.

So this is media creation.

This is creating a slide show.

This is creating video content.

This is making sure that the materials and the instructional information follows logical thought process

and development.

This is making sure that handouts and job ads are aesthetically pleasing, that the graphics are appropriate,

that they look professional.

This is all part of the development phase.

And again, with testing that you have to do some quality assurance.

You may have desktop publishers or graphic artists that will contribute to this work.

Other media creators.

You may be responsible for making sure that it meets the standards of quality that the organization

has.

You also might want to practice some of the activities that you plan on using, test them out, get

a group of of support staff to, you know, to practice what the activity looks like, the group learning

exercise.

Is it feasible?

Are you going to be able to roll it out to, you know, for groups of people simultaneously in one class?

She might want to test that out and then also technologies, too.

So if you're using some sort of projection, if you're using using some sort of interactive game, do

you have it all synched up?

Does it work?

So in one training organization that I worked at, we used to coat and Kahu is like a game show.

Everybody downloads it on their phone and, you know, you punch in as you would on a game show to give

your answer and you compete for who can do it quickest.

But again, you got to make sure that you know how to instruct people to download the app.

You know how to project the questions on the overhead projector.

So testing things out is really beneficial so you don't run into problems on the first day of class.

Step forward is actual implementation of your design, so the logistics of running the class learner

enrollments, which may include accepting payment from learners, classroom management and also setting

up the technology in the classroom, setting up computer labs, making sure that the hardware is, you

know, plugged in and functioning, that software is loaded, that all the devices are imaged correctly,

etc. That's part of implementation.

And then we have the delivery itself.

So communicating with the learners, communicating with the organization, making sure everybody is

aware of the assumptions for the learners and, you know, when they're going to start, when they're

going to finish, how long it's going to take, what they're going to learn.

There is some scheduling involved there with the training organization and also with the learners.

And then in delivery is also the actual facilitation of the course, you know, as a trainer.

And then also considerations for trainers is going to be recruiting qualified trainers that meet the

requirements that you specified in the design phase.

If they need some preparatory education to make sure that the trainers can deliver correctly, perhaps

new technologies, proprietary technologies, you'll need to make sure that they're up to speed on that.

And then, of course, you're going to have to book them.

Right.

If they're contracted technical trainers, this can be the case.

Sometimes you'll have to make sure that your class is running at a time when they can they can give

it.

They can teach you.

Step five, finally, is the evaluation stage, so this is how are you going to assess what new knowledge

the learners have acquired?

How are you going to assess their new competency?

And this can be done by, you know, end, of course, exams and also performance metric analysis that's

done after the course, also evaluating the instructor's performance.

So hearing back from the learners and we'll talk about specific ways you can do this in a future lecture.

But just like kind of the internal audit of the process, how did it go?

How is our trainer?

How are our materials?

How is the course design?

How do we think that that it all went?

What was the quality?

And then finally, you'll evaluate the course design.

So was it logical?

Did it meet the goals?

Was it effective?

And was it to the qualities, the standards of quality that we expect for our organization?

So there you have it.

Those are the five steps of the ADDAE model.

It's good to review these.

And I hope that you use this resource if you're ever in the position where you're developing curriculum

so that you don't start a class blind or with a weak design, but you can go through the five steps

and test things out.

And then when you implement it, when you deliver it, you feel confident about doing it and then you

can evaluate it.

When you're done, you can look back, reflect on what you've done, and you can improve it for next

time.

And this is an excellent way to continue improving your abilities as a trainer and a curriculum developer.

Donald Kirkpatrick was a professor at the University of Wisconsin, and he is famed for his four levels

of valuation model, which is an objective way to evaluate the success of a training event.

There is, Mr. Kirkpatrick.

So anyhow, what are these four levels and how do we apply them?

Well, the first level is reaction.

So what was the reaction of the learner?

You might get this in by way of a feedback survey.

A lot of organizations will, you know, ask the students what they thought about the training and you

can get some good response from that on the part of the learner as to whether or not they felt that

they learned anything.

What was the course like?

What was the trainer like?

And, you know, you want to find out whether the learner really felt that the course was practical

for them, engaging for them.

Interesting.

And that they left knowing something that they didn't know before.

The second level is the learning level.

And this has to do with actual knowledge acquisition acquisition.

And you get this information from the final exam.

Sometimes you can compare a post course exam with a pre course exam and you can actually have some metrics

on how much improvement there was on behalf of an individual learner.

So that's one form of evaluating a training event.

And then there is the behavior level.

So this is what was the actual change in the participant behavior?

What are they able to do now that they weren't able to do before the training?

And what evidence is there that they can do it?

So sometimes there are practical exams or actual performance based exams.

When you roll out a technical program where they actually have to do a technical task to pass the class,

and that will give you feedback on the behavior level of evaluation.

And finally results.

What are the organizational outcomes, key performance indicators that give evidence of the fact that

now students know something they didn't know before, they're working quicker, they're working more

effectively.

This is improving the organizational process.

This is making more money for the organization.

This is improving their compliance, whatever it was that their goal was, what are the results and

how do we document them?

So by incorporating these four levels of evaluation, you can really be thorough post course to figure

out, you know, how well we did lessons learned, where can we improve and was the course of success

and how can we make it even more successful next time?

So imagine, if you will, that you've just spent a number of months developing a wonderful course,

you went through the process of assessing organizational needs, learner needs and speaking with shareholders

and going through the ADI design process.

And you're about to give the course and then everything changes.

Organizational leadership asks you to make some significant adjustments to your course.

How will you respond?

It could be tempting to be frustrated, but the purpose of this lecture is to remind you to maintain

your flexibility and customize ability.

So there are always organizational perspectives that you may not be aware of that need to be addressed

last minute.

So it's important to not be so rigid in your course design or implementation that you can't respond

when necessary.

One way to facilitate this is to leave a little bit of a cushion room in your course design, you know,

so don't cram so much information in there that that there's no room for adjusting to things that come

up that are unexpected.

And then also remember to be customizable.

Maybe you bring a course with you no matter where you teach, you know, something that you've developed

personally.

But remember that there could be some custom features that are unique to the situation or the industry

that you're working with.

So build some customized ability into your course as you design it so that you're flexible.

Remember that you're building a business relationship with a training organization.

Your reputation is important after you're done teaching a course, you want to be invited back to teach

that course again or invited to develop a curriculum for another course and to teach that.

So cooperating with the training organization, being quick to be flexible and apply updates and implement

customized ability really is going to set you apart as a very professional and experienced technical

trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

Briefly, I wanted to talk a little bit about anticipating challenges in course design and course materials

if you're working for a larger training organization.

It's very possible that you are not the one who has developed the training curriculum or materials or

schedule or anything like that.

You may not have had any input into the design.

And there is a principle that you need to remember for the test is, is that of working cooperatively

with an organization, a larger organization.

So, you know, this isn't the time to call out errors in materials in front of a class that really

undermines the respect of the organization as a whole.

Or if there is a design element that you don't like or a module that you don't like, it's not your

responsibility as the trainer to alter that curriculum without the approval of the training organization.

Your responsibility is to deliver that information according to the design, because remember, there

could be some design factors, organizational needs, learner needs that you are not privy to.

You may not have that full perspective.

So it's important that you follow the design as it is presented to you and you're going to get a number

of of questions about this on the exam.

So basically, don't belittle the training organization, don't belittle the training materials, don't

call attention to flaws in front of the class.

If there is something that you really feel could be improved in the class or, you know, just something

like an error in a material typographical error or a constant error, then, you know, take that as

a sidebar with the organization, maybe, you know, report back to the curriculum developers to let

them know that there is an edit that needs to be made and suggest it respectfully.

And if a student brings this up, then defend the training organization, just be respectful, acknowledge

the fact that they brought it up.

Thank you for noticing that.

And I'll make sure that it gets passed on to the appropriate parties, but maintain a professional atmosphere.

And that way you'll really handle challenges as they come in a way that that is dignified.

!-------------------------------------------
It might be nice to think of yourself as a technical trainer that can just come on day one and deliver

an excellent course and everything goes on without a hitch.

But there are some logistical things that as technical trainers, we really need to give attention to

to make sure that the class runs smoothly and that we're prepared on day one.

For example, timing.

What's the schedule of the course going to be?

When will it begin?

When will it and when will you take breaks?

How many breaks will there be?

When will you have lunch?

How are the students going to get lunch if you're in a physical location?

Can you give them some direction on where they can purchase lunch or how they can store lunches that

they may have brought?

All of this is just some logistical considerations that you need to be able to communicate, either

in written form or in communications on the initial first day.

There's also time zone considerations.

If you're doing virtual teaching, you want to be specific about what time zone you're in and recognize

that if students are in different time zones, that could affect when you choose to take breaks and

lunch breaks and things like that for a physical classroom, there's also the logistics of reserving

a classroom.

Will it be available for the number of weeks or days that you plan on doing the course?

So, you know, training can fit in conveniently in conference rooms, but then larger technical training.

You know, you might need a class to be set up or a room to be set up for a full six weeks.

So where is this going to happen?

Is the organization OK with you taking that space?

Is it going to be undisturbed by others?

You know, in a in an organization with a lot going on, these are considerations that you need to plan

out ahead of time if training labs are outside of the classroom.

Have you reserve time in those labs?

If there are learning aides or materials, textbooks, workbooks that the students need to have before

day one, have you delivered them ahead of time?

Have they been sent out or have they been emailed with PDF?

That's a consideration to the logistics.

And as we talked about meal arrangements and other outdoor activities, if something needs to be taken

outside of the classroom, have you planned all the, you know, intricacies of getting the students

in and out of the classroom?

Make sure you get some consideration to all of these organizational things before you start teaching

the class.
!-------------------------------------------

Let's talk a little bit about in-person classroom set up that is setting up a classroom for in-person

technical instruction delivery, as you can see in a picture here.

Here is a beautiful training lab.

Everybody's got plenty of room and looks organized.

It looks clean.

Everybody can see the whiteboard.

They're going to be able to see the instructor.

I hope you have the opportunity to teach in a lab like this.

The truth of the matter is that you may or may not have any control over the environment, but to the

extent that you do, you want to create an environment that's conducive to learning.

So when students are comfortable and undistracted, they're free to learn and focus on the material

that you're presenting them.

So there are ways that you can make this happen for them.

You can set up the seating so that everyone has plenty of room, not only for themselves, but any bags

they might bring or materials that they need to have at their desks and give them space.

And you want to set up seats so that everybody has a direct line of sight, not only to you, as are

teaching, but also to your instructional media.

If you have a presenter excuse me, a presentation device, slideshows, if you have a whiteboard,

you need to make sure that every seat in the house can see that unobstructed lighting is important to

give consideration to.

If the lights are too dark, people can start squinting, they can actually start getting tired and

feeling of taxation without even noticing it.

So it's important that you set the lights to be bright and that you that you use natural lighting to

the extent that you have the ability to do that.

Same with temperature 70 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit, 21 to 22 degrees Celsius is considered comfortable.

If students are too hot or too cold, they'll be distracted.

You're not going to be able to make everybody happy.

There's always one or two that are going to be cold or hot, but, you know, be responsive to that

feedback overall when it comes to the majority and try and make sure that everybody's comfortable.

Cleanliness and organization also contributes to undistracted learning.

So make sure that everything is neat and tidy.

When you're setting up your your training space.

You also need to think about your materials.

So our materials already on the desk of every learner before they before they enter, are things easily

accessible if there are materials that they need to access during the course of the training, make

sure that's all set up before you start.

And then also very important and you're going to get a lot of questions about this on the exam is doing

a technology test before you start.

So you want to make sure that every computer is set up with the right software.

You want to make sure that your laptop can get plugged in and that you can connect to the presentation

screen.

You might need to liaise with lab technicians to make sure this is all set up.

You want to make sure cables are not going to present a tripping hazard for your students and that they're

neat and tidy.

You might need to bring whatever organizational device that you have to keep cables in place, you know,

so these are important considerations before you get started in a class.

And here's an example of how you might set up the class.

As you can see in this lecture, training style, every seat can see both the presentation screen and

also the instructor as he or she speaks as another option.

You have the horseshoe kind of style and that allows the chairs and the desks to be along the perimeter

of the room and the trainer to sit in the middle so that everyone can have an unobstructed view.

So it's nice to think that, again, we could just come in and have all this set up.

But that's not always the case.

And it's responsible as a trainer to go through the process of making sure that this is all set up before

you come and that you've done any necessary communication to make sure that the classroom is conducive

to learning.

!-------------------------------------------
Let's talk about virtual classroom set up.

So for those of you that will be taking the Teko 203 about virtual teaching, you'll need to pay considerable

attention to this.

But quite frankly, given current technological advances and I'm actually recording this during the

covid-19 pandemic, more and more training is going to be done virtually as we move forward into the

future.

So getting yourself set up with some good equipment is going to be more and more important and also

give you flexibility as a trainer.

You'll be able to take more opportunities and be able to do it from the comfort of your home.

So you can see in our picture here that our instructor has a nice camera and she's set up in a nice,

clean, organized room and is projecting very professionally as she does her training.

So some considerations here.

Getting a good quality camera.

You can get an HD webcam and there are about a hundred dollars now and they're substantially better

than the one that might come stock on your PC.

So so do some research into some affordable HD webcam that can give you a little bit better quality.

Or if you really want to get some great quality, you can get an external Destler camera that can interface

with your PC.

And a lot of YouTube viewers are using these now and the quality of their videos are incredible.

So if you can afford one of those, then by all means, that's a great option.

Microphones, you want to be able to be heard clearly.

Again, sometimes onboard computer microphones are not the best.

It's nice to have something a little bit more professional.

There are some really good condenser microphones for, again, around the hundred dollars, hundred

and fifty dollar mark that can really boost the quality of your sound virtually.

And then also a lapel mic is an option so that just clips to your shirts and eliminates some of the

background noise and just make sure that the audio is coming straight from you and is nice and clean

lighting in background.

Again, there's so many resources now on YouTube about how to create an excellent streaming picture

so that you have light on your face.

And so the so that you look professional, some great resources for that.

But yeah, a green screen can help.

They're relatively inexpensive.

You can even get one that clips on the back of your chair and then you can have any sort of virtual

backdrop.

Some lighting is good.

Little ring lights to put some light on your face makes a big difference.

You can see mine here.

Anyway, just a little thing that clips on my desk but makes makes a big difference in terms of the

quality.

And you may also have some some external stage lights too.

So I was thinking maybe what you could do is, you know, drop a little comment below as to some of

the equipment that maybe you're already using or that you plan on getting, that you that that's been

working out for you some quality.

You might even drop a link or two to some to some instruction that you've seen as to how to create great

streaming video and streaming audio.

Any resources that you'd like to share with your classmates, please drop them below.

But the point is, this is your classroom.

So let's make sure that it looks neat, orderly.

The whatever you have behind you is respectable so that you can really present a professional look when

you're teaching virtually.

!-------------------------------------------
Creating engaging presentations, so we're very comfortable nowadays using PowerPoint, it is a very

common tool that is used when it comes to training in organizations because it's so easy to project

it on a large screen for everybody to see.

And it is very versatile.

There's one thing to remember, though, is that expression you probably heard before death by PowerPoint.

And this is where a trainer will get in front of the class and just have some unattractive slides and

read directly from the slides.

And really, that is not teaching.

That's something that you will get points marked off on the performance based CTT plus exam.

And it's also a concept that you'll be tested on, possibly in the computer based exam to.

So just remember that you're teaching, you're having a conversation and interacting with the students.

But power points are supplementary.

They're auxillary, a way of presenting the main points and contributing to the teaching that you're

doing with your oral communication skills.

So some things to remember with PowerPoint slides be engaging but not distracting.

So color is good, but not every color animation is OK, but not every animation feature.

You want to make sure you don't use every tool to the point that it's, you know, distracting from

what you're learning.

But to add a little bit of aesthetically pleasing elements can be engaging for the learner.

About 15 words per slide.

So, again, you're not reading from the slide, but you're hitting main bullet points that provide

an outline for your teaching and for students to follow along with what you're teaching.

Also, we have worksheets and handouts, and this is really helpful for visual learners, as we'll talk

about further in the different types of learners that we have.

But, you know, to have something in your hand is a physical copy can help a lot of learners, but

just make sure it's well designed, you know, give some consideration to the aesthetics, the font,

the color, layout, graphics.

If there is a graphic design team in the organization, you might pass it to them for comments or for

them to touch it up, make sure that it meets the standards of quality for the organization and your

standards of quality as a trainer.

And you also want these to be interactive, too, to the extent that they can be creative representation

rather than just maybe regurgitation of the slides.

So a lot can be said for presenting in a way that is engaging if we give some consideration ahead of

time to the quality.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, so you've reached the end of your first domain domain, one planning prior to the course

and we covered a lot of information in this section.

So let's just review briefly.

We started by learning how to identify the organization and learner needs.

So this involves interviewing stakeholders in the organization, speaking to the learners themselves

to make sure that the objectives of your course, the purpose of your course, really fills the needs

of both the organization and the learner, and that there's real benefit to both parties.

And then we talked about developing learning objectives.

And remember, that was a three step process which started with this overall instructional goal or that

clearly defined high level objective of the course, which then informed the creation of a topical outline

where you would break out all the different subtopics.

And then finally, a clear articulation of the learning objectives.

That is the practical skills and abilities that the learner will be going home with.

So that is a process that is crucial to the design of your course and planning prior to the course.

We also talked about assessing current skill level.

So before you get too deep into your course development, you do need to know what the learner already

knows.

And that way you're creating a course that really, you know, touches on some fresh information and

is captivating for the learner.

We talked about the ADI methodology for instructional design.

Remember those five steps ahead, i.e. analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation.

So in the analysis step, you know, that's discovering organizational learner needs and defining clearly

the expected changes in learner behavior.

And then in the design section, that's all about creating the materials, making it practical and making

it engaging and learner focused.

And in the development, that's when you create sort of like a pilot of your program.

You do all the media creation.

Maybe you can do a practice run of the technological demonstrations and an implementation.

That's when you actually teach the course.

You take care of the logistics of reserving a room and making sure technology is in place and actually

delivering the course.

And in step five evaluation, you look back on what you've done, analyze what needs to be done to improve

the course, and also do some reflection on how you performed as a teacher.

So remember, all those steps of the ADI methodology gives you some real structure to how you develop

a course.

Finally, we talked about some training session logistics, how to set up a room, how to make sure

a schedule is created, how to deliver materials on time.

Well, we saw some examples on how to set up a classroom so everybody can see and create an environment

that is comfortable and conducive to learning, making sure it's clean, orderly.

The temperature and lighting is appropriate for your learners.

And again, something similar we talked about for the virtual environment to make sure you have a good

quality camera and microphone, you're familiar with the technology and that you still deliver a professional

product, even though you may be teaching from home.

And finally, we talked about creating engaging presentations, handouts and worksheets that are aesthetically

pleasing and accomplish a specific purpose.

So that is the main one.

I hope you've enjoyed it.

Please move on to the next section and go ahead and take the quiz for Domain one, and you'll start

getting ready for your CTT plus computer based exam.
