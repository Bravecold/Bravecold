!-------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------

All right, so before you move on, I wanted to speak with you a little bit about how the rest of the

videos in this definitive plus course are laid out for you.

As you know now, we've covered all the domains of understanding everything that you're going to be

tested on in preparation for the Teko to a one computer based exam.

But in addition to that, you're going to have to give evidence that you can perform all of these knowledge

areas in either the Teko 202 or Teko to 03, that is the classroom trainer or the virtual classroom

trainer, respectively.

So my suggestion is at this point that you make a decision on that.

Are you going to submit a video of your teaching in person or are you going to submit a video recording

of you teaching?

Virtually.

And so the way that the videos are set up now is that Section seven is specifically designed for the

Teko to 02 and Section eight is particularly for the Teko 203.

You really don't need to watch both sets of videos.

You'll find them a little bit repetitive.

And, you know, if it doesn't apply to the to the test you're submitting for, then then you don't

need to waste your time.

So keep that in mind moving forward, make your choice and go ahead and watch the videos in those sections.

We're going to cover everything from performance to recording to submission of of those videos.

So you'll be well prepared for that.

And regardless of which one you choose, I will see you all in Section nine.

We'll go over some, you know, last minute preparation for both the computer based and the performance

based exams and make sure that you feel motivated, encouraged and ready to go to get your certification.

I'll see you there.

!-------------------------------------------

At this point, we are ready to move on to the performance based portion of the exam.

Now, remember that when you submit your video submission for the Tokyo two or two or the Tokyo two

of three, you also have to include evidence that you have passed the computer based to a one.

So if that gives you an idea of the chronology of this, you will, of course, pass the computer based

exam first and then you'll include that as you move forward.

So as an overview for this section, we're going to look at all the information that's given by compter

on how to prepare for the video section.

They are actually grading you on the domains of understanding while you're delivering the class.

So you may have a lot of experience teaching.

Maybe you've done, you know, 20 minute classes for many, many years.

But you do need to make sure that you are identifying all of the domains of understanding and making

sure that you apply as many as you can in the actual video submission.

So we're going to talk about how to plan for this event, how to make sure you have all the logistics

in place so that you can get a good recording, how to prepare yourself to be on camera.

And then we're going to go domain by domain and talk about the scoring criteria that come to your users

and how they want to see that domain of understanding implemented in the video performance.

We'll go over some recording tips and then finally, we will go over the actual submission process.

So there is a form that you have to fill out as an instructor, which deals with the evaluation process.

And then, of course, you'll have to actually, you know, submit the digital files to come to you

and we'll go over how to do that, too.

So let's get ready for you to start your Teko 202 preparation.

!-------------------------------------------

So come to you does a good job of giving you everything you need to know how to prepare for the video

portion of this exam.

So I'd like to just take you through some of these so you know how to access them again.

Here we are.

Com tag go to certifications and CTT plus and you'll get back to the page that we went over in the initial

section of this course with all the information about the exam.

And if you scroll down a little bit, you'll find the CTT plus guidelines and forms and you can see

it's divided into classroom training or how to prepare and then also classroom train or submission form

and then virtual train or how to prepare and virtual train or submission form.

So here for the two to two.

We'll open that one up.

And here we are, well-prepared document again, you might want to print this out so you can take notes,

whatever is the best way for you to study the.

Taking a look really quick here at the table of contents, you'll see that there's some explanation

about the exam itself, also how to plan and prepare and also some information on actually recording

the session.

So there are some technical specifications that you really need to meet so that your video is not disqualified.

They're not overwhelmingly difficult.

You don't have to be a videographer to get this right, but you do need to make sure that you're following

those instructions.

And also a scoring guide and the retake policy.

Let's look at this scoring guide, because I think this is important.

Again, they're going to be grading on you on how well you demonstrate the skills involved in the domains

of understanding.

Now, if you'll recall, domain one, I mean, just get to it real quick here.

Domain one is planning prior to the course when you can't demonstrate in a live video you were planning

prior to the course.

And this is where the next submission document comes in.

And also Domain five is evaluating the course when you can't demonstrate that live in a performance

video.

So you're not going to have to worry about those.

But if you do move on to domain two, you start talking about actual instructional delivery methods

and media.

So these are the ones that you're going to have to perform in real time and weave into your recorded

classroom discussion as best you possibly can.

So, for example, domain two is methods and media for instructional delivery.

The first subdomain point is selection and implementation of instructional methods.

And in order to get the full four points, as you can see here, you're going to need to make sure you

fill the requirements of this column.

So moved from one instructional activity to the next, seamlessly address multiple learning styles through

planned activities and use anecdotes, stories and analogies and humor effectively.

So we're going to break this down in a subsequent video that we use in this section.

But I just want you to understand how you can use this scoring guide and really as a checklist, as

a matrix to make sure that you comply with all the requirements of the video.

Let's go back here and also look at the submission form document.

So Antico 202 is where you find the submission form here, you can click on this and download it as

a word document editable and that you will submit.

And so those domains like Domain one in five preparation's and of course, and post course evaluation

methods, you're going to have to give some long answers to show, you know, in actual narrative text

that you understand the concepts.

Hopefully your version of word opens a little quicker than mine here.

Give it a minute.

All right.

Here we are.

So you have to give some information on yourself.

You have to provide a copy of your completed CTT plus to a one.

And you also have to have signatures.

Remember this of everybody that's going to be involved in the classroom has to give permission to have

their video taken and submitted.

And if you move them here, you'll notice, as I mentioned, planning prior to the course.

And this is where you enter long answers to these questions that give evidence that you've considered

all the domains of understanding for domain one, for example.

And then there's another one on domain five.

We're going to talk about this at length in a later video.

But I do want you to understand where you can find these on the committee website.

Again, come to you about or click on certifications, come to the CTT plus and then move down here.

And the two forms are available right here.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, so let's talk about how to plan this training event so you can get a good recording to begin

with, you need to take a look at your content.

Remember, this is a technical training certification, so you need to be teaching something that's

sufficiently complex, something that is a real world industry, technical skill or piece of understanding.

So make sure you select your topic appropriately.

That being said, you don't have to go out and learn anything overly complex just for the sake of this

recording.

Use something that you already know well.

So, again, it needs to be technical, but I did just recently see a video that received a passing

score from the CTT, plus evaluators that had to do on how to choose the correct genes for your body

shape.

So, however, the instructor did a great job of weaving in all the domains of understanding and making

that topic sufficiently complex to show that they could teach any kind of technical topic.

So that's a possibility.

However, of course, you want to clearly choose something that's professional and from the industry

of your expertise, the structure of the video itself, you want to basically show this as a 20 minute

module.

And again, the timing is from 17 minutes to 22 minutes.

So you're giving like one module of a larger course.

So it needs to have a clear beginning, middle and end.

And you need to weave into the structure all of the 12 objectives.

That's the five domains and all the subdomains.

So make sure that you're designing and preparing this this small module in a way that, you know, you're

able to demonstrate all those skills in the setting.

Of course, you want it to be a technical training environment.

Quiet, well lit.

Of course, as you know, whenever you're doing anything on video, you need to make sure there's sufficient

lighting and you want to be able to show yourself as the instructor.

Also class interactions and materials.

So there needs to you know, if there's a whiteboard or a projection screen, make sure you have that

in the shot with you as the instructor.

And also the requirements state that from time to time, the camera should pan over to the students

to show interaction between the trainer and the students.

So you will need to show those students, which means you may also need a cameraman.

Right.

Somebody that the pans from you and the presentation material to the audience.

So the possibility to have somebody record for you or the other option is to set the camera up in a

way that shows both you and the audience so that you're able to see this classroom interaction.

But you need to be able to show it.

The class size needs to be at least five people.

Again, remember, they need to be able to provide their signature to show that they are willing to

be recorded and you want to show their interactions.

So hand raising, questions being answered, activities the evaluators need to see the student engagement.

Remember, this is learner focused training, not instructor focused.

And it needs to be authentic.

The students need to really be learning a new knowledge and skill, not artificial or contrived.

So you're not teaching something just for the sake of getting through this exam, but make it a real

piece of knowledge.

And if you've trained at all before, you should be able to select a module that you're comfortable

teaching with as part of a bigger program that you can then tailor to the needs of this submission.

But if not, you know, just make sure it's something that's real world applicable.

And the duration, as I mentioned, is 17 to 22 minutes.

If it's under 17 minutes, the video does not qualify.

It's immediately rejected.

If it happens to be over 22 minutes, then remember that the judging stops after a minute, 22.

So if you go to twenty three minutes that last minute, they're not even going to look they're going

to just stop the video at twenty two minutes.

So prepare.

Well, watch the clock, make sure it's between that seventeen and twenty two minute mark and don't

you know don't lose points for poor planning of the timing.

Your equipment use the best possible equipment that you have.

So if you have a high quality camera handheld camcorder, use that iPhones and smartphone devices have

excellent cameras nowadays.

And if you actually look at some of the videos that it provides on their YouTube channel about the preparation

for the CTT, plus they will show somebody with an iPhone on a tripod so you can use your iPhone.

There's no need to go out and purchase anything overly expensive to do this recording.

There is no editing allowed, so you're not going to trim this up like a like a nice YouTube vlog video?

No, there should be no editing.

If, however, there is a lengthy activity wherein the students are going to actually practice something

and then, you know, go off in groups and then come back, you are allowed to pause the video and started

again.

You're allowed one break for that.

If you do that, make sure that you are articulating that clearly at this point, the video will break

while the students prepare this skill or practice.

The skill will be back in ten minutes, but just one break is allowed for that.

So if you don't need to do it, I wouldn't suggest doing it.

And of course, you need to make sure you show your skills if you don't feel that you're there yet,

practices you may need to develop your skills.

If there's some issues you're having with communication, with your delivery style that you don't think

are really up to par at this point, then practice a little bit.

And I'm not encouraging you to postpone this any longer than needs to be done.

But, you know, overt practice out loud, sometimes standing in front of a mirror or practicing recording

yourself can help you develop your skills.

So you're comfortable when you're actually recording the the real video you'll submit.

And when you have everybody in the classroom, they're your five participants.

And, of course, make sure you understand the CTG plus domains and practice weaving them into your

delivery.

So this is a manageable task.

All the details of how to plan your video are in the document from CTT Plus.

And I've covered them again for you here and make sure you're prepared with everything you need.

!-------------------------------------------

You might have a lot of experience as a trainer, as a teacher, maybe you've stood in front of classes

many times before and you feel very confident about your abilities.

That's great.

But just make sure for the purposes of this video that you don't leave anything to chance.

You do have to be rather specific and get a lot in 20 minutes.

That really proves your abilities.

So this is probably unlike any other 20 minute class you've ever taught.

Be prepared.

Prepare yourself to be on camera.

You want to create a lesson plan so you're not just going to stand up in front of a group of people

and teach like you've taught before, have a specific outline incorporating all the topics that we've

that we've gone over thus far in this course so that it's logical, has a clear on product introduction

and conclusion.

When you are preparing your introduction, remember, this is the moment that you capture the interest

of your audience, prepare it a bit, make sure that you've practiced delivering it so that you can

really nail your attention.

A rousing introduction, the way that you want to prepare it out loud, create a checklist of required

skills.

This might be just a handy outline that you have on a desk while you're teaching that you refer to.

Of course, you're not going to be reading from the notes as you teach.

But but if you just have just a basic document to guide your performance, you'll make sure that you

don't forget anything by the end of the recording.

And you want to show interactive student centered learning.

So position the camera or have the camera person, you know, show that you are in fact asking questions,

moderating the group activities and open to questions, et cetera.

Rehearse your performance.

Don't leave it to chance, practice what it's like if you have five willing subjects that are willing

to work with you for, you know, a full hour, then you might do a dry run 20 minutes.

Let everybody know what it's going to be like.

Say, you know, I need to I need your assistance as a volunteer for a full hour.

Can we do it once as a dry run and then the second time we'll recorded record, both of them just in

case and give attention to your poise and personal appearance.

So all of what we spoke about, about standing confidently, dressing appropriately, being assertive

and commanding respect in the room, in the learning environment, all needs to be displayed, even

though this is somewhat fabricated.

Pretend like it's a real class and you're, you know, showing the best version of yourself for this

video.


!-------------------------------------------


So as I mentioned before, most of domain one will be covered in the actual submission form because

planning prior to a course isn't demonstrated able when you're doing a live performance that's going

to be in your long answers on the submission form.

But there are a couple of things that you can do to give evidence that you've handled this.

All the topics under planning prior to the course one A is review of organization needs and learners

backgrounds and relationship to course objective.

So you can make a couple little statements that can give evidence that you are considering the learner

needs.

You can make a comment about their profession.

If you're teaching something about technology, you could say, you know, I know all of you are in

the technology field.

I know all of your information technology.

Many of you been working for many years.

So I'm going to teach you this new topic that will, you know, reach whatever outcomes.

So you can just say it in half a sentence very quickly.

But it does address this topic.

You might make individual remarks like Mr Such and such and such and such.

I know that you are currently in this role in the company, or you might make a statement to say, because

I know all of you have this and that experience, because I know all of you are trying to reach this

goal.

This class has been designed so that you will come out with this learning objective.

So any brief comment like that will show the evaluators that you have taken into account the organization

and the learners needs one.

B has to do with the instructional environment in relationship to learning objectives.

So this has to do with planning a room, you know, arranging logistically a room so that it is conducive

to learning.

So, again, this isn't something you can spend a lot of time on, but some brief comments confirming

the logistics of the class and breaks.

You know, we're going to do this and then this precedes the lunch break.

Or you can talk about where all the materials are located in the class.

Briefly mentioned what you've done in the classroom, what you've arranged in the classroom to make

it conducive to learning.

You know, I've put all the materials over here or all the computers are set up like this that can just

give evidence that you have taken the time to prepare the logistics of the class and the environment

of the class in a way that considers the learner needs.


!-------------------------------------------

Domain two was methods and media for instructional delivery, and it's broken into two subdomains that

you will have to show evidence of your understanding in the performance based exam to deals with the

selection and implementation of instructional methods.

So however you have chosen to teach your class, you need to be able to move to a number of different

instructional methods seamlessly.

So as we've mentioned before, you're not just going to lecture the whole time.

You're not going to do question the answers the whole time.

You're not going to do group activities the whole time, but you will use a few of them at least.

So the requirements are to move seamlessly from one instructional activity to the next use activities

designed for multiple learning styles.

So remember that VAK model, visual, auditory and kinesthetic learners.

You might want to touch on a couple of those at least in 20 minutes and make it seem seamless, you

know, so don't make there be a big pause or shuffle or commotion or look like you've thrown up, been

thrown off your game when you're switching from one activity to the next.

And you may use anecdotes, stories, analogies and humor appropriately.

So smile a bit, maybe tell a joke, tell a story.

If it doesn't if it's not distracting and doesn't take away from your flow, weave that in there a bit

and be was the use of presentation instructional media.

You need to have more than two types.

So don't only use a slide presentation, you need to have that with in addition to another form of media.

If you choose to use that one and transition smoothly between them, make sure that you can move quickly

between however you are planning on using your media and use each form of media skillfully.

So have clearly in mind which sort of educational method, which element of educational psychology or

which specific type of learner you are targeting with the media that you use.

So, you know, if you are using slides, make sure that you're really harnessing the visual element

of that that can help learners.

If you're using a tactile skill, make sure that you are doing it in a way that shows that it's designed

for those who learn kinesthetically, etc..

So make sure you use at least two types of presentation and instructional media.

!-------------------------------------------

Domain three of your video performance, of course, you're going to have to show that you can communicate

clearly and establish credibility in the classroom.

So some of those behavioral elements of the instructor that we spoke about when we talked about domain

three, you'll need to be consistent with all learners and maintain positivity.

Well, that shouldn't be hard.

Likely you've chosen volunteers that you know well, maybe friends or coworkers.

So, you know, make sure you don't deride any of them or treat them with disrespect.

Maintain confidence.

Even though you are speaking with people.

Try to keep your poise together.

You're not going to have your head down reading from your notes.

But if you do have notes, you will just use them to remind yourself of a main point and then teach.

Looking up and maintaining eye contact with the audience using practical examples is helpful and also

responding to questions.

So if somebody asks a question, you're going to be able to clarify the question and give a clear answer

to it.

Now, given the nature of this video submission, you can plan some of that, too.

You might give one or two of your participants a question that they will ask in advance to demonstrate

your ability in that respect.

And again, when it comes to your actual communication skills, try to be clear and distinct in your

speech.

Make sure that your natural use, your body language and gestures don't do anything distracting, like

playing with your hair or fiddling with a pen or the, you know, the remote for the presentation screen.

Make sure you don't do anything distracting and make sure you stand in the correct place in relationship

to the presentation media.

So remember, everybody, at least if you're in an English speaking country, is reading from the left

to the right, stand to the left of the presentation screen, use emphasis and pausing repeat main points,

all those good elements of public speaking.

Again, practice this a bit if you don't feel comfortable, but you're going to do a great job.

!-------------------------------------------

You'll recall the domain for group facilitation is the source of over 40 percent of the grading criteria

for both the computer based and the performance based test for CTD plus.

So, you know, make sure you give some extra special consideration to really dialing in these performance

points on your video submission.

Let's talk about them.

For a establishment and management of learner centered environment, the instructor will clearly link

the learning objectives to the activities and content throughout the course.

So we talked about ways of previewing learning objectives and also emphasizing them by repeating main

points and reviewing.

So introducing them at the beginning of the module, reviewing them at the end of the module, and being

clear to the learners what the objectives are, is going to fulfill this requirement, continually focusing

on maintaining learner involvement and creating opportunities for all learners to contribute in group

dynamics.

So this is about the way you design your activities and your question answers and your group discussions.

Make sure you do so in a way that includes everybody.

Don't let there be one of your participants who is just kind of idly sitting by, make sure everybody

gets involved using the timing effectively to achieve the learning objectives.

Make sure this is clear in the design of your module, how you are going to cover all of the learning

objectives, how much time you're going to spend on each of them.

So you have time for an introduction.

You have time to cover the information.

You have time to do practice activities and you have time to review.

That all has to do with the structure of the module that you're building.

Let's see, use activities to promote the learning objective.

This has to do with tying the objective directly to the group activities.

They should be purposeful in their design in 4B centers again about learner engagement and participation

using open ended questions, not just questions like do you understand that?

Or maybe one word, fill in the blank answers.

Those do not promote group discussion, so stay away from those and asking follow up questions to encourage

reflection on the part of the learner.

So if one of your learners answers your question, you may then choose to probe again for more information.

This shows that you know how to assess learning and really challenge the learner to make sure they've

retained the information again, involve all the learners as much as possible.

Forese is assessing the learners need for additional explanation and encouragement.

So if you've been teaching for any length of time, you know that this is a big purpose of what you

do, trying to identify whether or not your learners really are getting what you're teaching them.

So whatever you use to monitor the learners behavior is important.

This is generally done with questions and asking them to do certain performance activities so that you

can kind of get an idea.

So make sure you give evidence of that in the way that you teach the class.

Clearly demonstrating response to a learner need for clarification.

So if a learner says, you know, excuse me, professor or excuse me, teacher, I don't understand

this particular item, make sure that you clarify the question.

OK, so you don't understand this.

You're having I need to explain this topic or that specific clarify the question and then give more

information.

Alternatively, use different words, a different way of explaining to show that you are really trying

to assess whether or not the learners understand it and then respond to any gaps in understanding and

then finally for D motivation and positive reinforcement.

So in the discussion of Domain four, we spoke a little bit about how to tap into learner motivation.

You might just want to remind the learner how the information is practical.

So if you can tie it to their career goals tied to their job roles, tie it to their personal motivators,

a couple comments like that to remind them can be helpful.

You know, you guys are going to need to know this technology when you get back into the office and

do this or you're really going to appreciate understanding this information is going to help you do

your job a lot faster.

A little comments like that give evidence of that and employs a variety of strategies to motivate learners.

So encouragement is one.

Positive reinforcement is very easy to do when somebody gives a correct answer.

A simple.

That's correct.

Great job shows that you are interested.

And creating a positive learning environment and motivating listeners and learners, so make sure you

give yourself plenty of time to go over these objectives and domain four so that you're highlighting

all of them.

Again, you want to get a score of four for each one of these sub points.

And remember that you're scored quite heavily on domain for group facilitation.

!-------------------------------------------

Finally, we have Demesne five evaluating the training event.

Again, this is a topic that will be covered in part in the form submission that goes along with your

video.

You'll be giving long answer, narrative style answers that need to give evidence that you understand

the principles of training or evaluating a training event that is evaluating the instructor performance,

the course design, the logistics of the classroom, etc..

So there's two sub points here, five a you will give evidence of during the video performance.

And this is evaluation of learner performance during and of the close of instruction.

So we already spoke about how you will constantly monitor whether or not your students understand what's

going on and you want to show that you can use a few different types of materials or media or methods

to evaluate knowledge.

So part of it is ask them questions.

You might show yourself delivering some sort of small quiz or you might have an activity that the learners

perform and you kind of walk around to all of their desks to show that you're giving some individualized

attention, making sure everybody understands the topic.

So make sure you use at least two or three ways of doing that.

And one of them at the end of the course to show that you're formally, formally evaluating the learners.

And then five B evaluation of instructor and course, as I mentioned, will be in the written responses

on the form you submit where you critique your own performance.

You want to offer insightful reflection of complete submission, course instructor learning and the

organization.

Make sure you include your understanding of the learning objectives, how you feel that your course

design touched on the learning objectives.

Make sure you have some positive and negative things to say about your performance as an instructor.

And if there's evidence to support some of your claims, be specific about it.

You might even put the time stamp where you show evidence of that behavior or where you see something

that could be improved or a group activity that was successful, etc. So you'll be guided through this

portion by the form that you submit.

Be specific, give lots of examples and we'll talk more about that form in an upcoming video.

!-------------------------------------------

When it comes to selecting your participants, you really have a lot of control over who you will use.

It's up to you.

The CTT plus official instructions say that you can use friends and colleagues.

So whoever you feel that you'd like to use, you will need at least five people.

And it's good to really prepare them a little bit about what's expected.

Remember that they will all have to submit their signatures for that little waiver that says that they

give you permission to record them during the class and also to submit the recording for the purposes

of the video exam.

But, yeah, they're going to have some questions as to what's going on.

So just be upfront, let them know that the recording is for the SeatGeek Plus examination and that

you have to give a sample instruction for 20 minutes, make sure that you lock everybody up at least

for an hour so that you can do a dry run.

And then the actual recording, if there's a little bit of prep work, you might want to, you know,

give yourself some extra time so that you're not inconveniencing everybody.

And likely everybody will want to know what do I have to do during the class?

And so depending on the nature of what you're teaching, usually probably they just come with a blank

slate, ready to participate in some training.

But, you know, if you're teaching a very technical topic, you do, of course, want to include people

that will at least have a basic understanding of the industry that your topic is related to.

So if it's completely over the heads of one of your participants, well, it's going to be hard to show

learner engagement and that you've taken in the needs of the students, et cetera.

So make sure that you choose the appropriate people.

And then, of course, it's OK to some, you know, stage some of the questions so that you can show

that you're interacting with the audience.

And so for those who are willing to contribute in that way, you can plan that ahead of time.

But again, you have some flexibility with this.

So make sure you feel comfortable and the people that you are inviting to be in your video submission.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's talk about some recording tips, ultimately, you don't want the low quality of your recording

to distract from the stellar performance that you give as a classroom trainer, these recording tips

are specifically called out in the documentation from CTT Plus.

So go back and look at the Teko Toyota submission instructions.

They provide all of these and more.

And even if you're not a videographer yourself, you can still come up with a really good quality video

that at least serves the purpose.

And by all means, if you're taking this course and you are a videographer, please just drop some simple

tips for us in the comments section so that we can all learn from your expertise.

Here, some brief reminders to make sure you get a good quality product, use a tripod.

Holding a camera is shaky and it will be distracting.

If you're using a whiteboard to write something, make sure you write legibly.

More legibly than normal, bigger than normal, so that it's clear and also clear to the camera.

Evaluators will be judging your presentation media.

So they need to be able to see it along those lines, too.

You want to minimize the glare on the presentation screen.

So if you need to angle it so that from the camera's perspective, there's no glare, do so because

evaluators need to be able to see your instructional media.

You were instructed to use only one camera, which is important to again, you're not going to be doing

any editing, so you need to just have one continuous video.

And also, if you are having to do and you zooming if you do have a camera man or woman, make sure

that your zoom is set to the widest setting.

And again, that helps it to be less shaky if you're moving the camera.

But ultimately, you can place the camera at the back of the room so that it shows you and your participants

and you won't have to do a lot of movement with the camera.

And that's a way that many people choose to do it, which is the easiest sound can be a difficult thing.

The onboard microphones and cameras are are never usually the greatest quality, particularly if you're

standing far away from the camera.

If you have it set up at the back of the room, it would be great to use an external microphone that

is of higher quality than the one that is on board, perhaps your phone or your video camera and CTT

plus or Acom to recommend, if possible, to wear a lapel mic.

And they are great because they limit any distracting noises going on around you.

And you can contribute to this goal of limiting other noises by, you know, making sure that the AC

isn't going to be too loud.

I mean, sure, windows are closed so that there's no, you know, jack hammers doing construction outside

or, you know, maybe making sure that the hallway door is closed so the passers by don't cause a disruption.

Do what you can to limit those noises, make sure the camera is running.

Don't miss any of your performance, particularly your attention.

A rousing introduction because the camera wasn't on and finally enhanced the lighting.

So if you know anything about video, you know how important lighting is.

You could use a camera light or as much natural light as possible.

And then, of course, make sure that the camera is not facing the light, but rather the light is behind

the camera and shining on you and your class as subjects of the video.

And you'll get the best possible recording that way.

Again, if any of you have any expert tips on video recording because of your specific experience,

please drop them in the comments below.

But don't be overwhelmed with this.

You don't have to create a marketing video.

You just have to show that you can perform the objectives of the CTT plus course in a way that is not

distracting.

So make sure of these things and you'll do fine.

!-------------------------------------------

On the official CTT plus page at CompE, teabag, again under CTT plus guidelines and forms, you will

find the submission forms here for Teko to to.

And of course when you click this, it'll ask you to download it.

We've been here before.

There are four forms that you have to submit forms.

See, we discuss at length in the next video.

But let's just kind of look at these so you have the opportunity to preview them in this profile section.

You're going to submit all of your information here.

You have to put your career ID number.

So you got that when you have done any other Kostia certification or when you signed up and completed

your come to Takio to a one.

And remember, photocopy of the score reports is required.

So make sure that you include that the form B is a release form, as we discussed.

That's the one where you have to grant come to your permission to use the recording and that anybody

who was a participant has their name and signature and grants permission for that to be used by committee.

We're going to skip forms.

We'll talk about it in the next video.

Those are the long answers.

And then finally, we have Form D, which is payment information.

Nothing too complicated here outside of your normal online payment.

And at the bottom of this form, too, you have submission instructions, which we'll talk about a little

bit later to.

!-------------------------------------------


Form, see, is where you provide longsword answers to questions centering around domain one planning

prior to the course and domain five evaluating the training event.

And of course, this planning and evaluating is specific to the 20 minute module that's recorded in

the video.

The great thing about this Form C is that you have all the time in the world to do a great job at it.

It's not like the computer test where you have a time limit and it's not like a video test where you

have to perform it well in real time.

You can draft the answers and take all the time.

You want to really give stellar responses and make sure that you hit all the requirements.

So in each question, what's great about this is that it gives you the specific subdomain where the

information that's being tested is found.

So go back on those points.

You can compare that to the scoring rubric that is in the submission instructions and you can just make

sure that you highlight every different point is mentioned there.

So it's not overwhelming here because you have an outline for you already.

There are a couple things to remember on some of these questions.

You have to give an answer that corresponds to the video submission.

So, for example, in five here, what did you do to prepare for training this particular group of learning's

learners for this specific recorded session?

If you adapted the material or made adjustments, explains what you did and why, if you did not need

to adapt to explain why this is not necessary.

But here's the point.

Note your response to this question must match what scoring judges observe on the recording.

So, you know, make sure that the two elements of your submission are not out of harmony.

Refer to something that you've actually done in the video submission.

And the thing with this is it can also give you some more information on what to include in the video

submission.

If you know you're going to be either calling it out in the domain one planning section or the evaluating

the training or section of Form C, then you can make sure that you perform it in a way that it's clear

to, you know, connect the dots.

So remember that they're after domain one.

Of course, we have the training evaluation.

Same thing here.

Make sure as you see here in number one, your response to this question must match what's scoring.

Judges observe on the recording.

And as we learned in the scoring objectives, it's good to put even timestamps on there.

You can say, you know, at minute one, one minute, 30 seconds, for example, you'll notice that

the instructor did this and you'll know that the student did that.

And it demonstrates this point or that point.

Be very specific and take your time with these answers.

You can edit it right here in the document and make sure that you include all the points and that you

get a great job.

There's no reason why you don't just get an excellent job of this because you have all the time to get

it right.

!-------------------------------------------


I'd like to redirect your attention to this portion of the how to prepare for the video submission document.

This is directly from Komp BTIG again.

And this section is called Performance Based Exam Recording Checklist for Quality Control.

Now, quality control is often done after something, an initial draft of something is created.

However, my suggestion to you is to ask yourselves these questions before you begin shooting your video,

because ultimately, if something is missed, you don't have to call all your friends and colleagues

again to do a second recording.

That's going to be a bit embarrassing, but you can read over this list as a checklist while you're

planning the video event and making sure that you've really checked the boxes.

So remember that this is here and please review it.

There are some excellent suggestions at the bottom about making a backup copy, not all, not only of

the video, but also of all the documentation.

In the event that something goes wrong with your initial video submission, you do want to be able to

perhaps reuse the forms and the answers that you've created in the past.

Hopefully you won't have that problem, but make sure there's a backup of everything so you don't lose

your work and refer to these questions here in the quality control of your video.

!-------------------------------------------

And just because I want this to be a seamless as possible for you to upload your video submission,

I thought we could just go over the submittal instructions and what it looks and feels like.

I don't want you to be overwhelmed by the technicalities of uploading your video.

So this information right here is taken again from the submittal instructions from come to your bag

that you downloaded.

It's on that same file under Form D, and as you can see, you have two options to submit your files,

the documents, the written documents and also the video file.

You can send it in by mail if that's your style, or you can do an online upload, which I'm guessing

most of you will choose to do at CTT submission dot com.

So if you go to CTT submission dot com, it will look like this.

And when you do this, make sure that you are ready and prepared with the information from your teko

to a one.

You will have to put in some information that you received on the printout for successful completion

of that course.

You also are going to need your company ID number and some personal information.

You'll set up an account, you'll perform an email validation, and then you will be prompted to submit

all your videos on this site.

So exciting.

Once you get that done, you're just waiting for a response from the evaluators ready to become a certified

technical trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's briefly review what we discussed in this Section seven, everything you need to know to submit

for the performance based classroom instructor TA to it's important that you watch all these videos,

review all the submission instructions from Compter before you hit that record button on your video

recording.

You're going to select five or more friends and get them all in a room and set everything up.

You don't want to get it wrong because it's very difficult to go through that process again.

So make sure that you've created a checklist, created a nice outline for your course.

You've practiced it out loud a number of times and you feel confident so you can get it right the first

time.

Again, my suggestion is perhaps to block off an hour of your friend's time so that you can do a dry

run.

And then the real thing, each video has to be about 20 minutes.

So you should have plenty of time to do that.

We talked about the evaluation criteria, criteria of each domain.

Again, make this kind of checklist and be sure that you are specifically doing these things when you

perform.

You may need to be a little bit more deliberate about this than you normally would be if you were teaching,

because you're trying to give evidence of all these points in 20 minutes rather than over the course

of an entire training event.

But be specific and then in particular form, see where you give those long answers.

Remember, you have all the time in the world to get that correct.

You can go back and identify the subdomain points and how they want to be evidenced in form.

See, and, you know, specifically call out all the points that will be evaluated and then also be

specific about where they show up in your video recording.

So use specific time markers and connect them to the learning objectives and connect them to the evaluation

criteria that you are demonstrating.

So everything you need is here.

And if you've made it this far, congratulations, because all that's left is, is to just wait on that

submission, to come back from the evaluators and you'll become a certified technical trainer.

So move ahead now to Section nine.

And I've got some parting words and some last minute prep that you can do before you start your tests.

!-------------------------------------------

So now that we've covered all the domains of understanding for the plus body of knowledge, it's time

to talk about how they apply to the performance based exam.

In this case, the TECO two of three, the virtual classroom trainer performance based exam now is important

to remember that there's a couple of things involved with submitting for this certification.

Number one, you're going to actually include a video of you teaching a class on a virtual platform.

But you are also going to be submitting some forms.

And one of the forms in particular Form C, which we will discuss at length, actually has some questions

that you will provide narrative long answers to the discuss how you've applied some of the bodies of

knowledge towards the preparation and evaluation of the course that is seen in the video.

So there's a couple of things involved here.

CTT plus resources from comp to lead you through the process quite well.

I'm going to direct you to where you can find those resources and, you know, make sure you have everything

you need for submission.

So we'll start off with those, come to your resources and we'll talk about how you can prepare yourself

to be on camera.

And then we're going to go over all of the specific domains of understanding and how you can give evidence

of those when you're recording your video.

How do you really weave all of those evaluation criteria into your performance to make sure that you

check all the boxes and get high marks on every domain?

We'll talk about some technical tips to make sure that your recording is quality.

And then we will go over the forms that you'll submit and in particular that form.

See, we'll talk about how you can provide answers to those questions that give evidence that, you

know, the domains of understanding.

And then I'll even show you where online you're going to submit the recording and the forms just so

that there's no surprises there.

So let's dive into the teko two or three.

!-------------------------------------------

So first of all, let's look at the information that is provided by committee itself, their official

resources, and there's two things we're going to talk about in this video.

Number one, it is the instructions on how to prepare for the video submitting.

And then second, it is the forms that you are going to submit.

And both of these are provided a tag.

So, again, here we are, come to a big hover over certifications and go to CTT Plus and you will arrive

at the informational page that we've seen before.

Scroll down a bit and you'll see the section called CP2 plus guidelines and forms.

And here is the the two forms I just mentioned, CTT plus virtual trainer, How to Prepare and CTT,

plus virtual trainer Teko two or three submission form.

Let's look at the first one.

And this is a well developed document from Compter that gives you all the information that you'll need

to prepare for the video portion of this exam.

There's some information on the, you know, general information about the exam, how to plan and prepare

some of the technical information about your recording.

All of this we're going to discuss in the videos.

But I do want to bring your attention now to the scoring guide.

And on page nine, they give you an indication of how they're going to score, which is really important

for you to know, because, you know, that's what you want to keep in mind when you're actually performing

the video and they show you that they have a scoring scale of one through four.

So what they're going to do is take each of the domains.

There's five domains, divide them into the subdomains.

So overall, there's 12 total subdomains.

And then they're going to give you either a one, two, three or four on each of the subdomains, depending

on how you perform.

And then they go on to tell you exactly what they're looking for in each subdomain.

So it's broken down very nicely for you.

For example, let's scoot down here to domain two methods and media for instructional delivery.

The first subdomain.

So Domain 2A is the selection and implementation of instructional methods.

And in order for you to get four points here, they show you the rubric.

They tell you exactly what you need to do to get four points.

So you can use this as a sort of compliance matrix to make sure that you're touching on all the points

you're going to be graded on.

It is important to remember that domain one and domain five domain one is planning prior to the course

and domain five is evaluating the course.

These are two domains that you can't show in real time during the video of you conducting your class,

because there are things that happen before and after the completion of a course.

Those are going to be evaluated based on the long responses, the narrative, written responses you

give in form C and we'll talk about later about how to do that.

There's a video on form C, but let me just show you how to find that one.

That is form C.

So moving on from this, How to Prepare document will go back to the informational page.

And here we have the plus virtual trainer Teko two or three submission form.

Click on that and download it.

When you open that document, you'll see these forms here and there's four forms.

Form A, form B, form C and form D, form A is just where you put in your information.

You have to include a photocopy of the score report from your computer based TECO to a one.

And you also have to give some witness statements, people that can attest to the fact that that's you

in the video.

So remember, you're going to have to do some of that.

And also Form B is the release form where everybody that's in your video, all the students that you

choose, give consent for you to video them and also to use their video for the purposes of this certification.

That's OK, then we move to form, see which we're going to speak at length, but this is where you

give the long answers to some questions, particularly covering domain one and five.

How did you plan the course and how did you go about evaluating the course and then informed there's

some payment stuff that you have to take care of here and some submittal instructions.

So those are the two forms that are provided to you from Tilla on the website.

Please make sure that you go there and review those before you get too far into the actual planning

and recording process for your submission video.

!-------------------------------------------

As I mentioned in the previous video, you're going to be scored on specific criteria for this training

event, so it's important that you plan for it and build all of the training criteria into this specific

module that you're going to be recording.

Don't think that because you have a lot of experience as a teacher or a technical trainer, you can

just get in front of a camera and do what you normally do and be fine.

This does have to be specifically designed for the purpose at hand.

So how can we do that to begin with?

Choose your content wisely.

It needs to be clearly professional and sufficiently complex.

This is a technical training certification, so your topic needs to be technical.

That being said, I did recently see a video that passed the evaluation of a teacher teaching her audience

how to choose the correct jean style for their body type.

It's not an overly technical topic, but it worked.

So you don't have to impress anybody with your technical skills, but make sure that you are able to

give evidence of all of the evaluation criteria.

You'll need to structure this module with a clear beginning, middle and end and interest, a rousing

introduction, presenting new material, having your students practice with the group activity, reviewing

and then closing the module as if it was a real world training event.

Let's talk about setting we're all familiar with, you know, doing Web streaming and video conferencing

from home.

So this shouldn't be a shock, but just make sure that you choose a quiet room, that it's well lit,

that anything showing behind you is neat and orderly and or use a green screen and you get to choose

whatever virtual platform you want.

So it might be Zoom or teams or Uber conference or, you know, any other software that you choose for

this event.

Just make sure that when you're recording, you have everything visible in one screen and that means

the trainer yourself, the faces of all of your participants and the training materials.

And that's usually easy to set up in one window.

So you can see it all in one place, but you are going to need that for the evaluation.

You need to have at least five people in your class and they all need to be visible and they all need

to be engaged, so they all need to have, you know, actual interactions in the class so you can choose

your friends or colleagues for this, even come to you.

Doug says you can do that.

Just make sure there are people that have enough of a technical background to where they can comprehend

the information and, you know, contribute significantly to the course.

My suggestion is to lock them in for about an hour and a half.

That allows you to maybe do a dry run of the 20 minute recording and then, you know, hit the record

button the second time and then also recognize that your participants are going to have some questions

about what's required of them.

So make sure you give them a heads up on what you need them to do to be involved.

You might even give them some questions or comments ahead of time that they, you know, samples that

they might use during the class and make sure this is an authentic event.

You know, your students should really be learning something new and not overly artificial or contrived.

Of course, this is stage to a certain extent, but it doesn't want to look that way to the evaluators.

And it needs to be about 72 to 22 minutes.

And I don't mean about I mean, it needs to be between 17 and 22 minutes.

If it's less than 17 minutes, it's rejected.

And if it's over 22 minutes, the judging will stop after minute 22.

So, you know, they're not going to keep scoring after that.

So with some preparation, I shouldn't be a problem to keep it to the timing that you need it to be

equipment use, the best possible equipment you have at hand.

There's no need to be going out and buying a lot of high quality technology for this.

This is not a test on your abilities as a videographer, but as a technical trainer.

So the webcam on your PC will work just fine.

Remember, there's no editing involved, so you are allowed one break if you need to stop the recording

while everybody practice is a skill or something.

If that's the case, make sure that you say out loud that you're going to be pausing the recording so

everybody can practice this new skill, cut the recording and then, you know, when you bring back

you can say again, all right, everybody is now had a chance to practice that skill and you move on.

But beyond that one allowable break, there should be no other editing.

So, you know, no graphics, no transition effects, anything like that.

It needs to be raw for the evaluators and take your time to develop your skills.

You know, if you need to practice this at home a few times in front of a camera to make sure that you're

not doing anything distracting with your hands while you're teaching and that, you know, you're poised

as an instructor, things like that, make sure that you build that up.

So you really feel confident before the day of presentation.

Understand the CTG plus domains very clearly have an outline so that, you know, you've touched on

all of them.

And we'll talk more about how to weave them into your recording in the upcoming videos.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, so now we're going to talk about how to apply each of the domains of understanding to the

video submission itself.

Now, remember, each of these domains is divided into subdomains.

And I'm going to show you how to give evidence that you know that in the video.

So in domain one planning prior to the course, a lot of this material is actually going to be in the

long answers that you provide on form C, you're going to give some comments about how you plan the

course and and how you assess the learner needs, et cetera.

But there are some things that you can do while the camera is on to show that you understand these topics.

So once a review of organizational needs and learner backgrounds in relationship to the course objectives,

you can say a couple of things during the class, maybe in just one or two sentences that touches on

the subdomain.

For example, you might say, I know you're all in the technology industry, so I know that you're going

to find this information really beneficial in your job roles, or you can call it a specific learner.

You know, Mr. Jones, I know that you perform in this role and I think you're going to find this or

that very beneficial to your job functions or make some comment about how you have tailored this particular

program to the individuals in the class.

Any brief comment like that will take care of this subdomain.

In one be the instructional environment in relationship to learning objectives, confirm the logistics

of the class, you know, let them know when it's going to start, when it's going to break, when it's

going to conclude, how long it's going to be.

Just a couple comments up front.

Confirm the student comfort.

You know, make sure everybody, everybody all set.

Everybody got what they need.

You got your webcams on and and everybody comfortable.

You can explain how you have created the virtual classroom environment in a way that's conducive to

learning.

So you might just call out some of the features.

You know, I'm going to be presenting this with my screen.

I'm going to be here.

This is how you can use the comments window if you like, et cetera.

So just specifically, call those out in a couple of sentences.

Don't spend a lot of time on it, and you will have taken care of domain one.


!-------------------------------------------

Domain two is methods and media for instructional delivery and in subdomain to a selection and implementation

of instructional methods, you need to show that you can move seamlessly from one instructional activity

to the next.

So, you know, maybe you're lecturing for a few minutes and then you move seamlessly into question,

answer or stimulating a group discussion and make sure that you have activities that are kind of designed

for everybody, whether it's the auditory learners, by means of a lecture, the visual learners by

means of a video or some activity where the students are involved and you use anecdotes, stories,

analogies and humor appropriately in to be this is important the way that you use the instructional

media in the virtual classroom.

How comfortable are you with the virtual classroom?

You need to make sure that you practice this ahead of time, that you can call up your materials very

quickly.

There's no lag time when you're showing a video or a slide that you can seamlessly work between you

sharing your screen and students sharing their screen if you choose to do it that way and also demonstrate

and confirm understanding of classroom tools.

So if you're going to use the whiteboard, if you're going to use the comments and questions, paying

any of those tools that come standard on these video conference software, make sure that you have explained

how to use it.

And also you've got some sort of confirmation from the students.

So, you know, if you guys have questions, please feel free to drop it in the questions, the comments,

pain.

Can everybody show me that they know how to do that?

And, you know, you accept a comment from students one, two, three, four and five.

Hey, I'm here.

I know how to use the comments section.

So give some evidence about that and make sure that you know how to use these tools.

If it's going to be too complex, then, you know, you might want to make it a little easier on yourself.

But by all means, use your instructional media smoothly and don't allow there to be any lag time while

you are switching to slides or videos, etc..

!-------------------------------------------

Domain three is all about how you present as an instructor, instructor and credibility and communication,

the first subdomain 3A is instructor delivery competence and content expertise.

And the main principal that's called out in the instruction guidelines is that you offer unique responses

to all the students in the classroom, particularly in the virtual classroom.

So you have consistently positive interactions with all of the students and that you're confident and

poised.

So if there's any kind of issues with the software, again, with some of this technology, it can be

a bit unpredictable.

But you don't let it frazzle you.

You just keep moving, address the issue and carry on.

And that when when people make comments or questions, you identify them as individuals and you give

unique responses.

So this is particularly important in virtual classroom so that people know that they're being identified.

So you might vary the way that you respond or the way that you classify information based on the needs

of the students and the specific comment from the specific student.

So be sure to show evidence that you're treating everybody as an individual and then in theory, be

instructor communication and presentation skills.

This has a lot to do with your clarity and pace, and they mention this quite a bit, that there's some

modulation of your tone, you're going up and down and that you are not speaking too quick and you're

also not speaking too slow and that you're natural.

Even in front of the webcam, you still want to minimize any distracting behavior, you know, touching

your hair or fiddling with a pen or something.

And you want to be coherent in your transitions when you move from activities and if you're bringing

attention to resources or training materials, make sure that you, you know, give everybody a heads

up of what you're doing.

OK, now I'm going to share this video or now I'm going to share this document, which you can find

in your resources on page such and such.

Be very clear about those transitions.

And it's also mentioned that you need to have the artful use of a pointer.

So as we know, the pointer can be a helpful tool to bring attention to a topic, the artful use of

a pointer.

One way that you can do this, I'm not showing a good example, but you can increase the size of the

pointer icon and have it not disappear when it hovers.

You can even change it to the little pointer icon.

So those are some creative ways that you can use the pointer to make sure that you're bringing out the

main points.

!-------------------------------------------

As you recall, domain four is where over 40 percent of the evaluation criteria comes from on the exam

group facilitation.

So make sure that you give some real focus to these slides and also to the preparation document the

content gives to make sure you're checking all the boxes.

So in 4A, you'll need to establish a learner centered environment.

So you need to clearly link the objectives to activities and content throughout the list.

This means that you're constantly reminding the students why it's important that they're learning what

they're learning and also to be clear about what the objectives are.

So the beginning of the course, you give a preview as to what they're going to learn and the, you

know, behavior change that they will accomplish by the end of the course and then continue to highlight

these so students know the main points and continually try to involve the learner.

So don't let any of the participants lag behind or, you know, start getting quiet throughout the whole

course so that they're not, you know, involved in the group activities.

And you also want to direct attention with your words and with your pointer.

So particularly in the virtual classroom, you can't point with your hands or use descriptive gestures.

So you are going to have to talk through people, you know, as they access whatever you're trying to

bring their attention to.

So, you know, take a look at the top right of the screen.

That's an example of how you use your voice to be the eyes of the participants and then also use your

pointer skillfully.

We talked about that, how to change it so that it doesn't disappear and increase the size.

You can do that in the settings on your PC so that, you know, you really highlight visually what it

is that you are bringing attention to.

OK, and also in the way that you use activities, make sure that they are related to the focus of the

learning objectives.

So activities are great, but they do need to be used purposefully, particularly to highlight the learning

objectives.

All right.

In 4B, you're going to promote a learner and promote learner engagement and participation.

So make sure using open ended questions, you don't want questions that can be answered like a fill

in the blank.

That's just a one word answer.

But require your students to give some explanation and then probe a little bit to really assess whether

they're learning.

You can use that by means of follow up questions and repeating what the what the student said to you

and then asking them another question to clarify and also make sure again that you involve all the learners.

Everybody has participation and use whatever virtual tools are at your disposal to confirm understanding,

particularly when you're moving on to another topic.

Does everybody can everybody see this?

You can ask and then you can ask everyone to put a thumbs up in the chat window, for example, and

then you can verbally confirm, all right, I'm seeing a thumbs up from from everybody.

So that's a great way to make sure that you're involving everybody, use their specific names to usually

in these virtual chats, everybody's name is in the corner of their screen.

So make sure that you you address them by their names.

And when they make a contribution, you're showing your appreciation by means of their name in Forese

assessment of learners needs for additional explanation and encouragement.

So you're consistently monitoring the learner behavior to see if they're understanding.

So if they're making a confused face or they look like they're drifting off, you're kind of watching

and then you're you're calling on them or you're asking if anybody needs clarification or even checking

in with individual learners.

And then if they do need clarification, they don't understand.

You can quickly re-explain something in a different way, using different words that adds clarity to

your initial explanation.

So this is just an interactive response throughout the course of the module.

And if you're using a chat window and if you've explained to the students that if they have questions,

they can drop them there, you know, call it out specifically.

OK, Mrs. Smith or Mary, I noticed that you left this question in the comments section.

So let me go ahead and address that.

You ask this.

So call out those tools to to show that you know how to manage the virtual environment well.

All right.

And finally, motivation and pause.

Of reinforcement of learners continue to connect what you're teaching to the needs and goals of the

learner.

We talked quite a bit about learner motivation, whether it's getting a new job, performing well or

using technology to make their lives a little easier.

Make sure that you remind them from here, you know, here and there in your discussion of why it's

important that they pay attention and motivate the learners by commending them.

And as I mentioned before, specifically using their name.

So, you know, thank you, Jim, for making that comment or thank you, John, for sharing your screen

and showing us how you did that.

You know, this is great positive feedback.

Just a simple, great job.

You know, thanks so much for bringing that up.

Will give evidence that you're creating a positive learning environment.

!-------------------------------------------

Domain five is evaluating the training event now, five, be the second part of this really takes place

on form.

See, that is when you provide the long answers there to some of the questions that are posed to you

as the instructor.

But five A is definitely something that happens in class.

So five is evaluation of learner performance during and at the close of the instruction.

So make sure that you have your students share their screen from time to time.

If they are performing a technical test, you need to be able to see it in an actual classroom.

You would be walking behind their computer screens and checking that everybody knows what they're doing.

But in the virtual setting, you need them to share their screens and then you can make comments on

what they're doing while they're practicing, you know.

Oh, Mary, I noticed you did that very well.

Thank you.

Or Jim, you know, great job implementing this piece of instruction, etc..

And then you're specifically asked in order to get four points to implement a final activity where you

evaluate performance of a shared application.

So this is an activity where they will have to perform it and you will have to watch them do it and

give some feedback.

So make sure you're familiar with the technology.

Make sure you know how to direct the students to share their screen.

And you can do that seamlessly in order for you to pass this virtual trainer certification five B again,

this is based on your long answers from form C.

We'll talk about that in a little bit, but you're going to be evaluating yourself and your course design

and it is important to be specific.

So when you say that you did this or did not do that, make sure you give time markers in your video

where you specifically highlighted that skill so that the evaluators know that you really did take a

look and reflect on your performance.

!-------------------------------------------

When it comes to selecting your participants, you really have a lot of control over who you will use.

It's up to you.

The CTT plus official instructions say that you can use friends and colleagues.

So whoever you feel that you'd like to use, you will need at least five people.

And it's good to really prepare them a little bit about what's expected.

Remember that they will all have to submit their signatures for that little waiver that says that they

give you permission to record them during the class and also to submit the recording for the purposes

of the video exam.

But, yeah, they're going to have some questions as to what's going on.

So just be upfront, let them know that the recording is for the SeatGeek Plus examination and that

you have to give a sample instruction for 20 minutes, make sure that you lock everybody up at least

for an hour so that you can do a dry run.

And then the actual recording, if there's a little bit of prep work, you might want to, you know,

give yourself some extra time so that you're not inconveniencing everybody.

And likely everybody will want to know what do I have to do during the class?

And so depending on the nature of what you're teaching, usually probably they just come with a blank

slate, ready to participate in some training.

But, you know, if you're teaching a very technical topic, you do, of course, want to include people

that will at least have a basic understanding of the industry that your topic is related to.

So if it's completely over the heads of one of your participants, well, it's going to be hard to show

learner engagement and that you've taken in the needs of the students, et cetera.

So make sure that you choose the appropriate people.

And then, of course, it's OK to some, you know, stage some of the questions so that you can show

that you're interacting with the audience.

And so for those who are willing to contribute in that way, you can plan that ahead of time.

But again, you have some flexibility with this.

So make sure you feel comfortable and the people that you are inviting to be in your video submission.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's talk about some of these recording tips that are provided by compter again, this isn't a test

about your ability to do Web streaming, but you do want to make sure you're providing a quality video

that the evaluators are not distracted in any way by a lack of professionalism.

So No.

One, stabilize your webcam.

This may not be a problem if you're using a laptop, if you're using an external device, just make

sure that you know, it doesn't move around or it doesn't kind of get wobbly if you nudge the desk,

et cetera.

If you use a white board application as part of your virtual classroom software, be sure to write legibly

so that everybody can see what you're writing.

Use only one camera.

So no fancy streaming work here.

Just one camera pointed at your face is all that is required.

And you probably know as well as most do that the audio coming through your PC or from some webcams

cannot be the best quality.

So if you've noticed that the audio is not clear, you might use an external mic if you have one.

A lapel mic is great.

Or, you know, if you have some sort of condenser.

Again, no need to go out and buy new materials, but just check that the audio is coming through clear

and limit distracting noises.

So, you know, make sure that nothing's too loud in your room, that the fan isn't making noise, that

nobody's mowing the yard outside your window.

There are no dogs barking or doors closing.

All of this can be a little distracting.

So find a time and location that is going to be quiet and make sure that your software is recording

so, you know, you wouldn't want to get halfway through your performance and realize you hadn't hit

the click.

It hadn't clicked the record button and practice that a couple of times and just make sure you're getting

the output that you want that you can hear and that you can see everything that you need to for your

recording and enhance your lighting.

That is big for Web streaming, particularly if you don't have a lot of good lighting in the room that

you're using.

You know, you can get a very simple ring light from Amazon for less than twenty dollars.

And it makes substantial difference to the quality of your video.

So you make sure that you position yourself so that you're getting the best quality possible on your

video.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, let's briefly review again the forms document and again forms A, B, C and D. We're going

to talk a little bit more about form see in the next video.

But Form A is just your profile where you give all of your information.

Again, there is this Tilla career I.D. number.

If you've taken a compter exam before, you will already have one of these.

And of course, at this point, you've already taken the come to a teko to a one.

So you will have been given a come to your career ID number.

Then also you are going to be submitting a photocopy of your come to your TECO one and you'll have to

confirm that you passed that first on following that is witnesses who states that you are the trainee

in the recording so they perhaps can audit this.

So, you know, obviously you're not going to do anything fraudulent here, but you do have to provide

some witnesses to that.

There's a release form for all of your participants and you're going have to email it to them.

And you're going to have to give some information there that you have received back their email consent

form to use their video in your submission.

Moving on, we get to form, see go to the next video for this one.

So I'm just skip past it and move down to form D, which is payment.

And of course you will submit your payment information.

And then so here's the information on how to upload, which will go over.

But just at the beginning, you know, make sure that you're recording in the right file format before

you get too far into this process.

!-------------------------------------------

The great thing about form see as part of your CTT plus exam is that you have all the time you need

to get it right, unlike the computer based exam, when you are, you know, under a time restraints

and obviously the performance based video exam, when you know you've got the camera on you form, see,

you get to take you take what time you need.

You can double check the requirements and you can go back and do a couple of drafts to get it right.

So again, all of the questions here are particularly focused on subdomain one A and one B. That is

domain one because it has to do with planning prior to the course and also domain five evaluating the

course post course.

So you're going to give some answers to this.

You can go to the subdomain one A requirements in the comp tag document and make sure that in the answer

that you provide, you've done exactly what it says in that document and there's no need to lose any

points here.

It is, of course, a reminder that you are going to have to give answers that correspond to the video

you're submitting.

So, for example, you'll see a note on this one.

Your response to this question must match what scoring judges observe on the recording.

So you can't say that you plan something and then not show evidence of it in the recording.

Same with evaluation.

You can't say you did something and then not show it in the recording.

It does have to be sort of real life situation here.

And then, of course, as I said, the second part is evaluating the training event.

And repeatedly, comedia content does require that you give specific references to the recording.

So my suggestion is to put timestamps as to when you perform a certain skill or instructor behavior

so that the evaluators can correspond your long answers to the video itself.

!-------------------------------------------

Now in the how to prepare for the Tokyo two of three document from committee, there is this nice list

of questions that you can ask yourself for quality control.

Now, when we think of quality control, we often think of something that is done after you've created

an initial draft to make sure that there is a standard.

However, I wouldn't suggest that you're doing it.

Do it in that order after you've gone through the preparation and the logistics of getting all your

friends and colleagues together to record an event you don't want to, you know, notice that you've

missed out on some quality control issue until after you've done all that work and have to do it again.

Right.

So my suggestion is that you read over these items as you're preparing.

Make sure you watch all the videos in the section that you read over these quality control items and

read all the literature from competition so that you don't have to do things twice.

However, that being said, if after you've done a recording, you find that it is clearly not going

to fly, that you are not going to get a passing score because you just know you have not touched on

the items like you should have, well, then you don't want to waste the money submitting something

that you know is not going to pass.

So if that is the case, you have to do a little bit of cost benefit analysis and risk assessment and

determine, you know, whether you're going to, you know, call all of your friends again and rerecord

the video.

So that's going to be up to you, of course, to hear suggests maybe get somebody else here at the bottom.

You'll notice this suggestion, maybe get somebody else to view the recording and assess it, create

a backup, make sure you don't lose it.

But again, my hope is that you will really put the preparation in.

Look at all these resources plan very carefully and only have to do the recording once.

!-------------------------------------------

And just because I want this to be a seamless as possible for you to upload your video submission,

I thought we could just go over the submittal instructions and what it looks and feels like.

I don't want you to be overwhelmed by the technicalities of uploading your video.

So this information right here is taken again from the submittal instructions from come to your bag

that you downloaded.

It's on that same file under Form D, and as you can see, you have two options to submit your files,

the documents, the written documents and also the video file.

You can send it in by mail if that's your style, or you can do an online upload, which I'm guessing

most of you will choose to do at CTT submission dot com.

So if you go to CTT submission dot com, it will look like this.

And when you do this, make sure that you are ready and prepared with the information from your teko

to a one.

You will have to put in some information that you received on the printout for successful completion

of that course.

You also are going to need your company ID number and some personal information.

You'll set up an account, you'll perform an email validation, and then you will be prompted to submit

all your videos on this site.

So exciting.

Once you get that done, you're just waiting for a response from the evaluators ready to become a certified

technical trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, let's go ahead and do our review of Section eight, everything you need to know to submit

for the ticket to 03.

As I said, this requires a significant amount of planning and logistics to get this video put together.

And I strongly suggest that you watch these videos thoroughly, that you review the submission forms

from competition, and that you also review the instructions on how to submit for the Teko two or three

that are provided on a comp tilla.

Org.

So by way of review, we talked about how you can get to those documents and what they look like.

We also talked about how you can weave in all of the evaluation criteria.

That is the 12 subdomains of understanding how you can weave them into your performance and give evidence

that you have acquired that knowledge and those skills when you are performing.

We also talked about how to give evidence of those domains of understanding on Form C, which is the

instructor evaluation form where you give some long answers to the questions.

And we talked about some technical quality control things for your recording itself, how to make sure

that you get the best quality recording in terms of your sound and lighting, and particularly for the

Teko 203, it is important that you really understand how to use the virtual software for your classroom,

understand the features, make sure that you can use them thoroughly and to contribute to learners,

and also make sure that you can go seamlessly between instructional media when you're presenting through

the virtual software.

So that's it for the Teko two of three.

I wish you all the best and I'm going to see you for some closing remarks before you get ready to submit

and take your test in Section nine.

I'll see you there.

!-------------------------------------------

Listen, congratulations, you've done a lot of videos here and you've done a lot of practice tests

and you're ready for this exam.

I'm confident that you're going to do well, not only on the computer based portion of the exam, but

also on the video submission.

So I just wanted to say congratulations, reminder that you've done a great job here.

And I also would like to just give you some last minute tips on how to prepare for your tests.

Just some advice here that might make it easier for you and make you feel more than prepared when you

finally sit the exam.

No.

One take as many sample tests as you can.

So I've included a number of sample questions here.

Go ahead and take the ones, the handful that are given at Contigo and anywhere else you can find them.

If you find officials plus sample questions, by all means, do them.

And you know, the more sample questions you experience, the better you're going to get at answering

them.

And, you know, sometimes you may even find sample questions that appear word for word on the test

itself.

So, you know, that can be really helpful to make you feel confident about a lot of the answers that

you're going to see on the test, particularly the computer based test, replicate the testing environment.

So, you know, likely you are going to be taking this test either in person view testing center or

maybe at home proctored through Pearson view.

That means that somebody watching you through your webcam while you're taking the test, but you might

sort of kind of create that experience ahead of time, you know, set ninety minutes on the clock and

then do one of your practice tests and, you know, just kind of visualize what it's going to be like

or, you know, if you're going to be taking it out of Pearson View testing site, go drive down to

the site that you're going to be taking the test and get familiar with the environment.

That can just take one more of the stressors away when it comes actually the time for the test.

When it comes to the material, know your strengths and weaknesses.

You're not going to know every domain of understanding as well as you do the other, particularly as

you're preparing.

But if you notice that you're getting some of the answers wrong in a particular domain, then go back

and review that one in particular.

If you create some flashcards or you go back and watch these videos, you know, focus on the areas

that you're weak at, there's no point, you know, going over information again, if you're getting

all the answers correct, it's your areas of weakness that you want to focus on.

So after you've gone through all this material, if there's still a spot that you're fuzzy on, go back,

watch the videos again, do everything you can to make your weakest domain of understanding your strongest,

and then finally use some positive self talk and imagery.

So when it comes to self talk, you know, sometimes we can get in our heads, we can say stuff like,

oh, you know, this exam is so hard or these questions are so hard to get that kind of that talk out

of your head and replace it with something positive.

You know, if this exam is legitimately difficult, maybe you could change yourself talk and you could

say, you know, I'm knowledgeable enough about this topic to take even a very complex industry certification

exam.

Right.

So you're acknowledging that it's difficult, but now you're spinning it in a way that brings some self

pride because you're prepared for this.

So cut out the negative self talk, replace it with positive self talk.

You're going to do fine on this test.

You're going to do great.

You're going to prepare well and you're going to knock it out of the park.

And then also some visualization can be helpful to this is a very powerful technique where you visualize

yourself seeing that word pass at the end of the computer based exam.

So you visualize what it's going to feel like when you're getting all the questions right.

And, you know, things like this can really help you to remain enthusiastic through the course of your

preparation.

Now, with the performance based exam, as I've said a number of times, just practice the the best

way to overcome your nerves about performance is to feel confident about what you're going to say,

practice as many times as you need to to make sure that you really can assert yourself confidently when

it comes time to click that record button.

You're going to do great on this.

You've done a lot of work so far.

You're going to do some last minute preparation and you're going to nail that test and become a plus

certified trainer.
