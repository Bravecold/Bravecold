!-------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to the definitive CTT plus course on Udemy, my name is Thomas Moore.

I'm going to be your instructor for the length of this course.

But before we get started, I thought we could talk a little bit about you.

What brings you here today?

What are your motivations for getting the certification?

It could be that you're already a technical trainer and you're required to get the certification for

your job.

It could be that you want to get into technical training and you'd like to put the CTT plus on your

resume.

Or maybe you're an I.T. professional already and you want to supplement your income by teaching some

technical courses here and there and you want the CTT plus to prove your abilities in the classroom.

But whatever the case, I want to assure you that this course is going to take care of your goals.

So the purpose of this course, number one, is to get you through the CTT plus exam so you can get

your certification.

So that's the teko to zero one or the computer based exam.

And then also the video submission exam, which is either the teko two to four in classroom teaching

or the Teko two or three for virtual classroom teaching, regardless of which one you're going for.

We've got everything we're going to talk about that moving forward to make sure you go over all the

domains of understanding and also have all the instructions for video submission and you feel well supported

for that.

So that's the first purpose of this course, is for you to get that certification.

But beyond that, you know, I'm really hoping that this can be a resource for you moving forward so

that you can feel confident as a technical trainer no matter where you teach.

So there's over 85 videos in this course.

They're short and to the point, but they cover all the fundamental principles of technical training.

And you have access to them as long as you have access to this course.

So, you know, in the future, if you need to dip back in, cover a specific principal or topic, you'll

be able to watch the videos again, refresh yourself and always feel prepared for whatever course you're

teaching.

So before we get started again, I'd like for you to just think, you know, pause the video for about

a minute and just think, why am I here?

What is my motivation?

You might think about your career, the kind of job you want to get with your certification, but I

want you to think even further than that.

Really, practically.

How is this going to impact your day to day life for yourself, for your family?

So give some thought to that.

And then in the comments below, just write your name and then a couple of bullet points as to your

main motivations for taking the course.

So, again, my name is Thomas.

I'm looking forward to being with you throughout this course.

Let's get started.

!-------------------------------------------

Now that you've introduced yourself in the comments below and told us a little bit about your motivation

and goals, I figured I'd tell you a little bit more about myself.

My name is Thomas Moore.

I've been in the education industry for over 15 years and I've taught all sorts of audiences from one

on one education of children, teaching in public schools, private schools, all the way to adult education,

group learning and also technical training.

And I've taught all sorts of technical concepts from music theory and composition to foreign language,

grammar and delivery and then also information technology, cybersecurity.

I've taught some of the federally recognized baseline certifications for work in the government sector,

and I've also worked with technology organizations as they developed courses for technical training

for the maturation of their resources.

So I hope to bring all of this experience together in these videos, hopefully with stories and some

anecdotes that will really bring life to the program and help you see what it's like in the real world.

So anyway, that's me.

I look forward to teaching with you and let's go ahead and move on.

!-------------------------------------------

I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about the benefits of having the plus certification, the purpose

of the certification is to prepare somebody for entrance into the field of technical training, obviously.

And it's meant to give evidence that you have met a certain standard of excellence when it comes to

being able to train complex topics.

So, as you know, competition is a provider of technical certifications.

But if you've worked at all in technology, you recognize that there is a big difference between being

able to perform a technical task and being able to communicate it to others, to really teach it to

others.

And so this certification is meant to fill that gap is to give evidence that somebody not only can understand

a complex topic, but can also communicated to others and has a certain level of public speaking ability,

presentation ability so that they could lead a class to learn a new skill or ability.

So that's what the certification says about you and it's on your resume.

Also, it's trusted by some leading organizations like Dell, Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco, IBM.

They all look to the CTT plus certification as evidence that, you know, you're a qualified trainer.

Some people will also get the CTT plus if they work for an educational provider or an academy, because

competition allows you to partner with them as a company.

If you have the seat plus of somebody on the staff, has the technical trainer certification, then

you can become an authorized training partner with TI and they'll send you some resources and they'll

also help you market and give you some some content for your courses.

So look into that.

If you work for an organization, that can be an excellent opportunity for you to gain some sort of

job security in your training organization, because you can, you know, convince them to become a

training partner with come to you.

Beyond that, you know, having a training certification really gives you confidence.

It allows you to know that you've been certified in this rather than an organization, perhaps an internal

training, just grabbing somebody from a different project to teach.

They can rely on you because you have a certification to back up your ability to communicate and teach

technical concepts.

Another thing to remember is even though there's a lot of online learning, people still enjoy having

an instructor to guide them through the process of learning a new topic.

Reading a book is one thing, but having somebody who knows how to do something, teach you about it

really is irreplaceable.

And so, according to a recent survey, 87 percent of people who are taking on a new difficult concept

prefer to have instructor led training as their primary form of training.

So this is something that's still very relevant, even in a time when we have access to all sorts of

materials on the Internet.

!-------------------------------------------
All right, so here we are, the definitive CTT, plus everything you need to pass the TETCO to a one

to two and two or three.

So I thought I'd start by just giving you an outline of the course, almost like a syllabus of what

to expect in this course, how it's divided up, how the information is divided up so it'll be easily

accessible to you.

So let's just jump right in on that.

The first thing we're going to talk about is an overview of the certification itself.

So as you've already heard me reference, there are three different tests here.

What are those tests?

What's involved in each of them?

How can you be prepared for each of them?

What do they look like?

What do they feel like?

That's what we're going to talk about in the overview of the certification.

And following that, there is a section of videos for each of the domains of understanding.

So according to the official contact plus domains of understanding, there are five domain one planning

prior to the course, which is where you talk about classroom logistics and of course, creation domain

two methods and media for instructional delivery.

This is where you talk about technologies and means to disseminate information to a class domain.

Three instructor credibility and communications that has to do with your oral presentation skills and

ability to manage a classroom domain for IS group facilitation.

That's where a large portion of the information comes from.

That has to do with activities and group dynamics and adult learning theories and things like that.

And Domain five is evaluating the training event.

So this is what you do as a technical trainer post class when you evaluate yourself and also the course

design, et cetera.

So those five domains come from compter itself.

That's what the test is based on.

And there is a section of videos for each one of those domains.

As we move forward, after the domains of understanding, we're going to be focusing on the classroom

performance based exam.

And this is the part that kind of can make some people nervous because, of course, this is a video

submission of you teaching a class practical application of the skills that you've learned.

But don't worry, I'm going to break that down for you.

All of the submission details, all of the things that you're going to need to perform well and touch

on all the domains of understanding and your performance.

So there's a section for the Teko 202 and the section for the ticket or two or three.

And depending on which one you choose, you'll probably only watch one of those sections of videos.

You're welcome to watch both, but you'll probably choose whether you're going to do a classroom based

or virtual video submission and then you'll watch the videos in this course that correspond to that

selection.

!-------------------------------------------
So first of all, what's the difference?

Why are there three tests, Teko to a one, to a two to three, which one am I taking?

Why do I need to take more than one?

These are all kinds of questions.

Maybe you're as confused as this guy up here.

Don't worry.

You're not the first one to have these questions.

We'll go ahead and break this down so that you understand it.

So, first of all, everybody will take the teko to one.

This is a computer based exam, much like all the other compter certification exams.

Maybe you've taken eight plus net plus security.

Plus, there's a multiple choice questions, single and multiple responses.

So sometimes it'll be pick the best answer.

Sometimes it'll be choose all of the answers that apply or choose two answers, but multiple choice.

And there is the possibility of dragon drops.

Although the most recent time I've taken this test, there were no dragon drops.

There's going to be a maximum of 95 questions and 90 minutes to take the test.

So again, this is similar in length to other technical certifications.

You have just under a minute per question, but it's plenty of time, especially after this course.

A passing score of about 73 percent is required.

So you'll need to get about 655 out of 900 points to pass the test.

And this has to be accomplished before you move on to the second half of this certification exam.

So everybody will take the Teekay 020 one, which is the computer based exam.

But then after you've passed that, you'll have the option to choose either the Toyota or two or the

Teko 203.

Both of these are performance based exams.

They are video submissions of you teaching a class.

The Toyota Otu is a video of you teaching an in-person physical classroom class, whereas the Toyota

of three is a recording of you teaching an online virtual class through video conference.

So you'll be able to choose which one you want to do and depending on which one you choose is the certification

is that, you know, the test that you choose either the two or two or the two or three.

So hopefully that clears it up.

Again, this is a video submission.

It'll have to be between 17 and 22 minutes long.

You're scored on all the criteria of the domains of understanding and you're asked to rope them into

your presentation again.

We'll talk about that so you know how to do that.

And then you have to pass about thirty six out of forty eight to get a passing score on this.

Here's what it looks like.

This is from official compter resources, so again, it shows the teko to a one computer based exam

and then you will add to it either the teko to a true classroom performance based exam or the Takio

two or three virtual classroom performance based exam.

Either one of those you pass and you come out as a plus certified technical trainer, either as a classroom

trainer or a virtual classroom trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's take a minute to review some of the official resources the competition provides that you can use

to prepare for this exam.

Here I am at Tilla Dog so you can put that in your browser to tag click here on certifications and of

course, you're going to see us.

Plus, so here on the plus page, there are some documents that will be very helpful for you to to read.

You might want to print them out and read them to give you a good overview of what to expect.

So after you've read a little bit here about the overview and purpose of the course, there's a section

here called Plus Guidelines and Forms, and there is a form here for how to prepare for the classroom

trainer and then also how to prepare for the virtual trainer.

And this is a very well prepared document with a lot of information about how they score the video submission

and how to prepare.

So this is information that we're going to be discussing in this course, but it might be nice to read

it.

Also, you can print this out or I'll save it as a PDF and read this when you have a few minutes.

So that's how to prepare for the performance based course.

Also here, we'll have the submission forms for the video performance based submission.

We'll go over that later, too.

But this is how you find it here.

Also, I wanted to show you this.

This is get practice questions and exam objectives.

If you see right here, you can just submit a little bit of information about yourself

and about your job description.

Choose the exam.

We're looking for tickets to a one put in the country.

You want to have some exam objectives and practice questions.

I'm currently training plan on taking the exam one to two months, agree to the terms.

And as soon as you submit that, you will have two things.

First of all, the exam objectives and also practice questions.

So the exam objectives we're going to be going over in a subsequent video will be going over the domains

in depth.

But this has come to a version of that.

You can see all the five domains, some details about the course in the test itself.

Again, I recommend printing this out and reading it when you have a moment.

They also have some practice questions here.

There aren't very many practice questions provided here.

It's really not the end all for your preparation for your exam.

I've included a lot more practice exams in this course as part of the course materials, but you can

look at a few here to get a sense of what the questions are going to be like on the Teko to a one computer

based exam.

So it would be worth downloading this and practicing them as you get through the course.

When it comes time to buy the exam, you can get your vouchers here.

One thing I failed to discuss in the previous video, but it's important to know you're going to be

purchasing two tests.

As I mentioned, you taking the TKO to a one and in addition to it, either the Teko 202 or two or three.

So you're going to have to purchase both of those.

First of all, you'll purchase the Teekay 020 one, which is the essentials.

And then when you're ready, you'll purchase the classroom trainer or the virtual classroom trainer.

So that brings the cost to a little bit over 650 bucks.

But remember, you will be buying two of those vouchers.

So anyhow, this is a competition, Doug.

This is how you can find the official resources to prepare yourself for the exam.
