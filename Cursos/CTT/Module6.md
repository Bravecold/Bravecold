Dumaine five is our final domain of understanding for the plus, of course, and it really deals with

evaluation and there's a number of different things we're going to be evaluating at the conclusion of,

of course, the students, what they've learned and their increase in knowledge, the instructor, how

he or she performs, how effective were they at delivering class material, the course design itself.

So all these things are going to be evaluated and there's also the documentation of that evaluation.

So there's the communication of lessons learned with the organization that's delivering the training

with the trainer so that they can make improvements.

So they've dedicated an entire domain to this, which shows the importance that we don't just deliver

training and then forget about it and move on, but we really take the time to look back a little bit

reflectively and determine where we can improve and what changes need to be made to create an excellent

course.

So look forward to that.

In this section, we'll talk about ways to assess learner education, ways to assess the course and

its effectiveness and how to communicate that with the organization.

Let's dive in to Domain five.
!-------------------------------------------

Here we are in domain five, evaluate the training event, the first thing we're going to evaluate is

the achievement of learning on the part of the learners.

So here are some things to keep in mind that will guide you as you attempt to determine whether or not

the students have really absorbed the material and whether you've facilitated that change in behavior

that you're looking for in the student.

So, first of all, is to evaluate the learner competence, so when you're testing for learner competence,

you're looking to see whether they've retained new information.

Can they deliver back to you what they've learned?

Does it seem like they've really created a new place for it in their minds and they're going to retain

it when it comes to technical abilities?

And we also need to see that they can practically apply the skills of the training.

So can they perform the motor skills associated with whatever technology that you're teaching?

And also, you want to assess the learning goals that you established at the beginning of the course,

so have the learners truly accomplished the objectives that you set out to accomplish for this course?

So you're going to reflect their current state with their previous state and see whether you have really

addressed the learning objectives.

There also performance based exams that you might create if you're dealing with a technology, hardware,

perhaps, or software, and you want to see whether the students can truly work with it and you want

to create a realistic performance based exam, and then you can score students based on the time it

takes for them to accomplish it.

Perhaps their accuracy with the tool and how well they perform a certain task.

All of these can be the criteria that you use to to score them.

And again, this is based on the learning goals.

So you're not going to throw any curveballs in there and in your performance based exam, ask them to

do things with the technology that are not specific to the learning outcomes.

While you may, you know, play around a bit with the technology in class, you make sure that you only

test on the requirements of the class itself.

And it's important to remember that particularly when you're working inside an organization with employees,

that this is all based on the change in the Lerner's behavior.

So can this employee now do something better, quicker, more efficiently, more accurately than they

did before?

So assess change in learner behavior and remember the organizational needs.

So why did they bring you in as a trainer to begin with?

What were they trying to effect?

What change were they trying to affect among their staff?

Have you accomplished that?

And this is specific to their roles.

Right.

So you you may be dealing with, you know, a certain technical staff and they have certain functions

they perform every day.

We want to make sure that they can perform the behaviors that you're trying to teach within the the

parameters of their job role.

And again, you want this to be reasonable.

So you don't need everybody to come out of the class being an expert at the software.

But you need to hone it in on the specific motor skills and knowledge that the organization requires

in their staff and that they hired for you to to really teach their resources.

So hone in on those specific learning objectives and make sure that when you were testing for success

of achievement, of learning that you incorporate these things in all of your assessment methods.
!-------------------------------------------

Not all evaluation of the training event is done at the end of the course, there's value to doing some

assessment throughout the course so that you can make adjustments as necessary in the way that you deliver

the material itself.

So that brings us into formative assessments.

They're called formative because as the name suggests, they help form the course itself as it's going

on.

So these are presented at intervals throughout the class.

So rather than all the way at the end, the end is sometimes too late to know whether or not your students

have learned anything, whether or not your course is being effective training events already over.

You want to gain some of this insight as you're going along.

So form formative assessments are periodically given throughout the course, and it provides a lot of

intelligence for the instructor so that they can identify where to make adjustments in their class to

make sure that the learning objectives are completed by the end of the course.

So as is mentioned here, it guides the instructors based on the feedback from the students.

So you may, in these sort of formative assessments, add some long answer questions, really assess

for learning.

Don't make them too easy because you want to get a pulse on how well the students are doing.

And you also help the students identify target areas.

So if they're getting tested on the main learning objective topics throughout the course, then the

student starts to realize where to focus their attention.

So you may be giving some extra information throughout the course, but they start to understand really

what the key learning objectives are and it helps them with their attention and, you know, with their

preparation for final exams, et cetera.

And also, it gives the trainer opportunity to provide follow through when a student submits a test

and they've done poorly, the trainer can identify areas of need.

They can perhaps do one on one tuition with the student to address some of these concerns or if the

entire class is behind on some topic of understanding and they really haven't grasped what you as the

trainer were trying to teach them, then you may need to dip back into that topic, recognize that you

need to address it again, that there was some miscommunication, some some lack of connection there

between you and your class and address it so that you're still on track to reach those learning goals.

And this allows the learner to gain clarification ongoing to assess how they're doing and make adjustments

as they continue to learn.

So formative assessments are very useful to guide the delivery of the course and give you an idea of

what's going on in the learners minds as you're teaching.

!-------------------------------------------

Next, we have summative assessments, so this is quite different to formative assessments to happen

throughout the course.

Summative is like a cumulative exam at the end of a college course.

It's the final exam where you assess for understanding of the entire course material, all of the learning

objectives all at once.

This can be in the form of a written exam, for example, Multiple-choice, or perhaps some long answers,

but something that, you know, is filled out, either computer based or pen and paper at the end of

the course, or it can be a performance based exam.

So as we mentioned before, it could be a task that they have to complete in a certain amount of time.

It could be some sort of project that they have to deliver to the instructor at a certain time in the

course, towards the end, of course.

And or it could be, you know, some function that they have to perform with software or hardware and

they have to give evidence that they can do it proficiently in order to pass the exam.

So you have quite a bit of leeway in how you design that performance based exam.

But if you are particularly training a technical skill, a motor skill, then it is good to have perhaps

both of these perhaps a written portion of the exam and a performance based portion of the exam, depending

on the nature of the information that you're teaching.

And don't try and trick up the students.

Don't try and make this exam hard or be a super strict teacher that has a high standard of learning.

No, this isn't the time for that.

Again, you're trying to focus on the needs of both the learner and the organization.

So the learner needs to absorb this information so they can move on, maybe so that they can attain

a technical certification, maybe so they can get a new job.

They need to know just the basics, just the requirements so that they can improve knowledge of that

topic.

And inside an organization, you're not trying to make anybody feel like they failed, but you want

to assess for changed behavior, make sure that each student is able to perform the new skill or has

acquired the knowledge that they're going to use in their day to day job functions.

So you're not really trying to make it really difficult, but you do want to assess that the learner

has grasped the main learning objections and reached the learning goal.

!-------------------------------------------

Just because you've reached the end of the training event doesn't mean that your obligations to your

students have been fulfilled.

You may choose or you may be contractually obliged to offer some post course supports.

I worked for Technology Academy and with each of their courses, whether it was Contee plus net plus

security plus an alias cloud certification, whatever it was.

They also offered academic advising and career development support.

That was kind of like a bonus that they offered with each course.

So that meant that all of the trainers had to have office hours where students could approach them and

ask questions.

You know, how do I put this new certification on my resume now that I've got this certification?

What which one should I pursue next?

This is particularly important for career changers as they enter into a new industry to understand the

business culture of the industry that they're entering into.

And it can be very valuable so that they get more support than just the information at hand.

As a technical trainer, if you're working by yourself in your own organization, you may choose to

offer.

This is certainly is a perk for many students, or you may be contractually obliged, as I mentioned,

with larger organization for X amount of weeks after a training event to be available via email or phone

to students who need clarification or further support.

So make sure you understand what those contractual obligations are and that you figure out some system

that works for you to offer that kind of support.

So this might be by email.

It might be available by phone.

It might be, you know, giving certain, you know, times that you're available for meeting invites

to support the students, make sure you're clear with management on that and give the advice that that

really will be beneficial to the careers of the individuals that you're teaching.

If you're working for a larger organization and you are also an employee of the organization in addition

to a trainer, then that can really facilitate some some excellent communication for added support as

you move forward.

!-------------------------------------------

And then, of course, report is exactly what its name implies, it is a report that you submit to the

training organization at the end of a training event.

This is usually used by mature, well-established training organizations as a way to do a lessons learned

review or the completion of a course it may be provided to you in an actual formalized document template.

They'll probably give it to you at the beginning of the course and ask that you submit it at the conclusion

of the course with some vital information that they can use to move forward.

You will probably be asked to include the class name, instructor name, the number of students, how

well the students did.

So evaluation metrics, what percentage of the students really met the learning objectives of the course?

There'll be some options for student commentary.

So the things that they liked about the course, the things that didn't go over well, the concepts

that were extremely difficult and that perhaps need clarification in future curriculum developments,

etc., and then you may have an opportunity to give some feedback to the organization about your experience,

too.

So what was the training room like, the environment?

Was it comfortable in terms of temperature and lighting?

How was it working with the technology and the hardware?

Was everything smooth or were there some difficulties?

You might give some comments on the schedule and the breaks and all of the course logistics.

This is your opportunity to improve the situation for the next trainer or for you if you train at that

organization again and it is good to give some strong recommendations.

This can really establish you as a respected voice in the industry when you have the courage to stand

up and tell the training organization or even perhaps your employer what needs to be improved so that

this this can be a better product moving forward.

So you might want to hone it down to maybe two or three items, but then respectfully deliver those

things because it does help an organization and they'll value that feedback.

It'll get you invited back, particularly if you do it in a very professional manner.

Now, if you're working for a smaller organization that doesn't have a formalized process for and of

course, reports it might still be a good idea to develop your own, give them some feedback.

Don't just leave.

Once the class is done, pack up your bags and go.

But at the very least, send an email with some of this crucial data and particularly these these strong

recommendations for improvement.

And it will, you know, increase your reputation as somebody valuable to work with, easy to work with

and cooperative with the goals of the training organization.


!-------------------------------------------

It can really be a challenge for some of us to receive constructive criticism on our course design or

on the way that we delivered the course material, particularly if we spent a lot of time designing

a course and we're very proud of it.

And we really gave it our Alderney during the training event.

It can be hard to receive feedback on things that the training organization would like to be changed.

It's important to remember and you're going to get some questions like this on the computer based CTT

plus exam that this is not your training product.

It belongs the course design.

The curriculum belongs to the training organization and you are delivering it for them.

So it is still good to be responsive to the feedback that you get and flexible enough to implement any

changes that the training organization asks of you.

And this benefits the training organization because it allows them to increase the standard of the,

you know, training materials and the training event that they're delivering to their customers or to

their employees.

And it also benefits you as a trainer because it helps you grow.

And even if you're fundamentally opposed to some of the feedback that you get, you can at least learn

some flexibility by applying what they've given you.

And this goes to your professionalism and your reputation as a trainer.

So if you are known as somebody who is cooperative.

Who is professional and is open to feedback, then you're going to be easy to work with, you're going

to be invited back to teach and your business reputation will carry on with you.

So you may get some, you know, uncomfortable feedback.

Maybe somebody will audit your class.

Maybe they'll be you'll get some feedback on the training materials on the way a group activity was

executed on your delivery style.

You know, maybe you said too many hours or arms or you didn't stand with posture or they might have

some feedback on your choice of uniforms.

All of these things can be challenging to hear, but cooperate with the training organization, be flexible,

and you will develop a good reputation as an excellent technical trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

Another party to the evaluation of the training events are the students themselves.

This is particularly the case if you work for an organization that's charging a lot of money for a training

course.

From the organization's perspective, a student is their customer and they want to make sure that their

customer is satisfied in information technology certification courses that I have experience training.

Sometimes they charge two thousand dollars or more for a six to eight week course.

And when this is the case, students are really investing in their future career or education and they

want to make sure that they're getting their money's worth and so does the organization.

They want to reach a certain standard of excellence.

And so by submitting these post course kind of feedback reports or surveys to the learner, then the

organization can really get a pulse on, you know, how the learners feel about the product that they're

delivering.

So these summative evaluations will happen at the end of the class.

They'll be performed anonymous anonymously by the students.

So they won't put their names on these on these forums, either electronically or on paper.

That way, they don't have to feel sheepish about grading you as the instructor poorly, perhaps if

there's something that you could do to improve.

And it's it's good to be aware that these sort of evaluations are going on, keeps you on your toes

as an instructor, you may be graded on your technical expertise, on your ability to manage the classroom

or how clear you were in your instruction.

And also the student will have an opportunity to rate some of the course materials, how it was presented,

the logistics of the course.

Were they comfortable in the environment, the classroom, how did the technology work?

And usually organizations will do this either electronically with an email link to an online survey,

or they might perhaps give a pen and paper survey at the end of the course.

And a great way of really finding out how people feel is to use a Likert scale.

And we've done these before.

It's when there's usually five options that range from strongly disagree to strongly agree with neither

agree or disagree in the middle.

And it'll make a statement, for example, how, you know, how would you rate your agreement with the

following statement?

I was comfortable with the temperature of the training lab, and then the student will have the opportunity

to, you know, fill in the blank whether they strongly agree with that statement or disagree or the

extent of how they felt.

So Likert scales are great if you are developing these sorts of evaluations so that you can improve

the development of your course, use a Leiker scale, make sure these go out to the students and use

them as a gauge to improve the product that you're delivering.

!-------------------------------------------


You'll recall the Kirkpatrick evaluation model from an earlier video, this model is used to identify

and articulate the actual goals of the training event.

So when you're designing the course, what do we want to get out of this?

What do we want the learners to have learned?

What what results do we want to attain organizationally and in the learners abilities?

So we use the Kirkman's Kirkpatrick model then when designing the course, and now we're going to use

it again when evaluating the course.

So we're going to go back to those goals that were informed by the Kirkpatrick model and then ask ourselves,

well, did we meet these goals?

And as you recall, there are four elements reaction, learning, behavior and results.

So the first one is learner reaction.

What is their immediate reaction to the course?

Did they enjoy it?

Do they feel that they learned something new?

Were they comfortable with the instructor?

You might get some of the information in this first element from the Likert scale feedback survey that

we talked about in the previous video.

The second element is learning achievement.

So when you give them the final test at the end of the course, performance based or written based test,

did they really learn what you wanted them to learn?

What were the learning objectives?

And are the students now able to understand, you know, that new knowledge and retain him in behavioral

change?

We've spoken before about how it's important to really identify what behavioral change you want to affect

in the students.

So now the question is, can they do this thing or this task that they were not able to do earlier,

whether it's an improved ability with the technical software hardware, their ability to apply it effectively

in their job roles, can they actually perform that behavior now?

And then finally results?

When you're working with the organization and you're training their employees, for example, they're

going to be very interested in the results of the training they brought you in and they paid you as

a trainer and they paid all these curriculum developers so that they could get a return on their investment.

And it might be that, you know, there are hoping that once everybody understands this technical topic

or the software, that now they can perform their job functions better, make more money for the company

because they'll be more proficient and productive in their jobs.

Or as we said, it could have to do with some sort of auditing process, a security process.

So can they now show that they need compliance because everybody's trained on a certain security topic,

for example?

But the point is, were the organization's goals met and how can we show that they were met?

So you use this Kirkpatrick model not only when designing the course, but now in evaluating it, going

back to the goals that you set for the course, clearly articulated goals and now evaluating whether

or not you met them.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's talk a little bit now about and of course, communication with the training organization, as

you can see, image below, you want to have a nice handshake of mutual respect when you're done with

your training event, whether you're an employee with a company that's training ongoing or training

is only part of your duties or you're in a contractual relationship, whatever the case, you want to

be very professional about the training and maintain a positive business relationship.

No.

One, fulfill all your contractual obligations.

So if there are any follow up activities, any end, of course, reports, you might think you're in

the free and clear when you finish that last day of class.

But that may not be the case.

There might be some, you know, paperwork to be done to really seal up this end and conclude this obligation.

So make sure you perform all that and get it done timely and and do it thoroughly correspond to some

of the students reports.

Make sure all that gets done on time.

And then we talked about the value of offering feedback.

You may have to, you know, or you may be asked to teach this course again.

And if you found some real, you know, flaw in the course design or the curriculum that you really

felt could be improved, then it really makes sense to communicate that with a training organization.

So the next time you teach it, you don't have that trouble.

Again, something about the environment of the classroom that wasn't conducive to learning or wasn't

comfortable for you or the students.

It's good to speak up about those things.

And, you know, organizations, as I've mentioned before, really value this feedback because they

obviously want to create a high quality product and high quality experience for the students.

And so when you are when you speak up and very clearly articulate what could be improved, then they're

going to really appreciate that feedback and it's going to increase their respect for you because you

spoke up about that and are contributing to their goals as an organization.

Whatever you do, maintain professionalism, so you want a respectful relationship, if you are contract

and teacher, then you may be teaching at a number of different institutions.

Your reputation goes with you.

If you seek to be employed long term, then obviously being somebody that is easy to work with and professional,

we'll do a lot to establish you in the field as a professional technical trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

That's it for Dumaine five.

Good job at this point, we have covered the entire body of knowledge for the CT plus exam.

There's some things we're going to discuss in the next two video sections that talk about how to submit

the forms for the performance based class and how to incorporate some of this knowledge into your performance

based video submission.

But for now, you can congratulate yourself because you've covered all of the domains of understanding

for the test.

So great job.

Let's just review Domain five before we move on and before you move on to take the quiz below.

This was all about evaluating the training event at the conclusion of the course.

Make sure you know the difference between formative and summative assessments.

Again, formative are offered periodically throughout the course and they provide insight to the instructor

and also help guide the focus of the students.

And then summative assessments can be either written or performance based final exams.

We talked about some things that happened after the course, like post corps support methods, how you

might have some obligations to students beyond the conclusion of the course to offer clarification or

give them education or academic or education or career advice.

And we also talked about communicating with the organization through and of course, reports and being

clear about positive feedback that you can give to the organization or constructive feedback that you

can give to the organization from the perspective of the technical trainer.

And we talked a little bit about learner management systems keeping good track of all of the students

and where they are in their academic journey.

And again, we spoke about evaluating the training delivery and how important it is for you as a trainer

to be open to that feedback.

We talked about the feedback forms that students may complete that will give feedback to the organization

not only on you as a trainer, but on the course design and the logistics of the class and the the learning

environment to.

And finally, we looked again at the Kirkpatrick evaluation model and those four elements of evaluation

that went into the creation of the course and now are going to be reassessed at the conclusion of the

course to identify whether you met the needs of the training organization and the learner.

So that that wraps it up for domain five.

I think you're ready to take the quiz.

Please move on and take the quiz and then I'll see you in the next section.
