We've talked a lot so far about developing a high quality course methods of delivery materials, educational

psychology, but a lot of the effectiveness of a course still hangs on the delivery of the instructor.

So Domain three deals with instructor credibility and communications.

So in this domain, we talk a lot about how to present confidently and gain the respect of the learners.

And we also talk about communication skills in public speaking skills and also dealing with behavior

in the classroom, interactions with students.

So there's a lot to cover in domain three.

Let's jump right in.

!-------------------------------------------

The nature of the business relationships that you're part of as a technical trainer could be varied.

You could be a self-employed trainer hosting virtual training or perhaps at an on site location, or

you could be contracted by a technical training organization, maybe here or there or on an ongoing

basis as an instructor.

Or you might be doing internal organizational training as an employee.

But whatever the case, it's important to keep your business relationships professional and to maintain

that standard of professionalism as a trainer.

And there's a bit of a balance here, because as we've spoken about already, we do want to create a

sort of casual atmosphere in the classroom where people are at ease and they can feel comfortable admitting

to what they don't know and learning new material and really having that no stress environment in the

classroom.

However, it is still your sense of responsibility as a technical trainer to maintain a level of professionalism

in all of your dealings.

So you are the one responsible.

That, of course, material is covered, that the class stays on track, the business and learning objectives

are accomplished.

So all the principles of professionalism apply as a trainer, for example, making sure that you're

a dependable, reliable, that you arrive on time, that you answer correspondence for the training

organization promptly, that you always have professional conversations with students even when their

behavior is less than professional.

There are elements of business ethics and honesty that need to be considered, as well as the way that

you present yourself in terms of what you wear and how you look in the technical training class.

So your reputation as a business person is very important.

It will come with you no matter where you teach.

And if you are teaching on a contractual basis, you know, you could you could work within a number

of organizations.

So maintaining this professionalism, make sure that you're the kind of trainer that is invited back

after you teach your class.

And that is easy to work with and cooperates well with the organization.

So remember to keep things professional and you'll be successful as a technical training.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's start with demonstrating confidence and mastery of your subject.

Now, remember, you're not going to be the number one subject matter expert of everything that you

ever teach.

That would be unrealistic to expect of anybody.

There are going to be people in the world that know this technology or this topic better than you.

There might even be people in the organization that know it better than you.

But that's OK, because what you're teaching in your class are a specific set of learning objectives.

And as long as you know those well and you're a master over those topics, then you will be able to

deliver that material confidently.

So you've done a task analysis on the technical skills you're teaching.

You know how to do them.

You're smoother doing them and confident in doing them.

So as long as you deliver that material, you will be fulfilling a responsibility of, you know, the

technical trainer and meeting the goals of the course.

So remember that it's OK that you don't know everything.

You can be modest and that will set your mind at ease a bit.

But there are some things that will really help you to be confident when you're delivering the course

to begin with.

As you'll see here, preparation.

That is a key to feeling more comfortable, particularly when you're speaking in front of others.

So prepare your presentation.

Well, prepare the learning space so there's no surprises.

You know, make sure you know where all the materials are.

Make sure you know how your presentation devices plug into each other.

Make sure all the cords are wrapped up so you're not going to trip or anything like that.

Also, be sure that you know the technology well, that you can move around the computer that you're

using, make sure that you have the IT staff on speed dial.

So if anything comes up unexpectedly, you'll be able to resolve it quickly and then also prepare your

actual delivery.

You might stand in front of a mirror and practice giving your introductory remarks eventually.

This kind of public speaking comes easier.

But in early days, you may need to do some actual outloud delivery to make sure you feel confident,

particularly on the first day.

Your clothes are another thing that will contribute to the look and feel of confidence.

As you can see above us, this fine young lady is dressed business appropriately, so she's able to

present confidently because her clothes say that she's a professional.

And so, you know, make sure that you're dressed in a way that commands the respect of your audience

and feel comfortable in your clothes.

So wear something that you're not going to have to worry about.

So you feel confident in your skin when you're standing in front of people.

If you're standing and sitting, make sure your clothes look and feel appropriate when you're standing

and sitting so that there's no surprises there.

You might even buy a new outfit, right?

That always makes you feel good.

You get some new clothes and then you feel confident about the way you look.

And that can really build you up so that so that you really, you know, manifest, you know, command

attention when you're in the classroom.

You also want to manage the physiological anxiety.

So things like butterflies in the stomach and shaking hands and sweating and things like that, I mean,

a lot of it is out of our control.

But there are some things you can do to calm some of those symptoms down.

For example, deep breathing, you know, taking some slow, deep breaths.

And that really helps you to let go of some of the anxiety and provides oxygen to your mind and to your

brain so that you can be more calm.

Stretching is good for that, too, bringing blood to all your muscles and joints and getting you a

little bit energetic about what you're about to present.

Visualizations are good, too.

You can imagine giving a successful class.

You can see yourself in your mind's eye as a successful teacher, and that can build your confidence

subconsciously also.

No, your subject, we talked about this a bit, you don't have to know everything but understand each

topic thoroughly, prepare from the learners perspective.

So what are the question marks that will appear in a learner's mind?

Anticipate the questions that they're going to have from their perspective.

You already know the learner needs.

You already know where they're coming from and the extent of their existing knowledge.

So be prepared to fill those gaps and to get questions about them.

If you haven't, you know, been working with the technology recently to make sure you review any updates,

there could be a software update that's come out since you last taught the software or the technology.

Make sure you're up to date.

You don't want any surprises when you're standing in front of the classroom.

Be modest, recognize your limitations, recognize what you don't know, and feel comfortable being

able to say that to people.

It doesn't reduce your respect.

If you just simply say, I don't know.

You can always say, you know what, I'm not sure.

Let me do some research and answer that question later or get back to you later in the course with the

answer to that and limit irrelevant questions because some questions are meant to just test you.

They're not relevant to the learning objectives and the tasks at hand.

And it's best to just pass those over.

And, you know, you can just, frankly, state that they don't relate to the course material.

And, you know, if you want, we can talk after class about it, but let's not distract the classroom

from the topics at hand.

So don't find yourself in a situation where you're trying to give wrong answers to a question just to

maintain your image, but be modest.

And finally, how to actually present confidently.

Well, you want to have a friendly but authoritative tone.

So remember, you're the leader of the classroom.

You don't have to be arrogant or snobby about it, but just, you know, command the respect, have

the authority as a teacher, but be friendly about it to maintain good posture, stand up straight and

keep eye contact.

Eye contact is very reassuring to learners and it definitely communicates that you're in charge and

you're going to complete the class the way it needs to be handled.

!-------------------------------------------

In the first few minutes of the class, you're going to want to connect with your learners.

So even though you have this leadership position, you want to command, respect and be authoritative

in the classroom, you still want to put your learners at ease and connect with them on a human level,

sort of break the ice.

And this can be done right from the outset in the way that you interact with the students as they're

coming into the room.

And then in your introductory comments, so as are coming into the room, you can be shaking hands or

greeting people.

You can be introducing by first names, introducing yourself, getting to know some of the motivations

of the students and their, you know, career and educational backgrounds that can be done before class.

And then in the very first few minutes of the class, you can use some techniques to break the ice and

gain the learners attention, really draw their attention into you.

So you might, as you're preparing your course, be very specific about your opening comments, particularly

on day one.

And then as you go through the course, perhaps at the beginning of every day to make sure that you're

connecting with your audience.

Well, how can you do this will be relatable.

Put yourself on the peer level with your adult learners.

So in what way are you similar?

What experiences have you had that are very similar to theirs, either in employment, career, education?

You might even crack a joke, get everybody laughing.

That puts people at ease.

And then when you begin speaking, you could use in a rousing introductory statement, some sort of

statistic or insider knowledge that kind of, you know, shock and bring everybody's attention in.

Or you could use a thought provoking group question.

So this would be something that you pose to the learners to get them thinking and talking and engaged

from the very beginning, you know, what do you think about this and open it up to class discussion?

It's a great way for people to maybe make their first comment in the class, maybe introduce their names

to this where you're connecting with the audience.

You also want to tell a story or another option is to tell a story.

So a little bit about your experience with the technology, with the organization in the industry.

And that can be a great way to put yourself in the same level as the class.

And then again, as we've spoken about earlier, the most important thing is the students understand

the value of what they're learning.

So right from the outset, to be clear about the learning objectives, tie them to learner motivation

and help them to see the practical value of what you were going to be discussing.

So as it says here at the bottom of the slide, number one, connect and then command their attention.

!-------------------------------------------

Part of being a professional is cooperating with the training organization, you want to be somebody?

As I said, that's invited back somebody that's easy to work with to where the interaction is seamless

for the organization.

Make it a pleasure for them to do business with you.

That's going to get you invited back.

It's going to give you the opportunity to teach again.

So there are some things that really help you to be cooperative that we're going to talk about here

to begin with, speak respectfully about the training organization.

So sometimes trainers will make the floor of, you know, feeling that speaking disparagingly about

the employer is a way of connecting to the audience.

But that's not very professional.

And it can it can sour you to the organization.

So find a different way to connect, but make sure all of your comments are positive about the organization

and appreciative for the opportunity to teach in and for the opportunity to work, etc..

Cop excuse me, cooperate with policies and procedures.

So if they have guidelines for teaching, if they have guidelines for addressing grooming, uniform

and guidelines, conduct guidelines, make sure you know what these are and you follow by followed by

the rules.

You don't want to be dinged on not following some H.R. requirements and you don't want to, you know,

make an uncomfortable situation where the organization has to speak with you because you've broken one

of their rules and you weren't aware of that.

So make sure you're familiar with them and cooperate with them as best as you can.

In line with this, too, is contractual obligations.

So there's a question specific to this, I think on the CTT plus exam, which is, you know, for example,

if you are asked to be available to students following the course and you've finished teaching, which

is a contractual obligation, is that you be available.

You know, you do want to leave your email so people can follow up with you and ask questions about

the material.

So be clear about those things in the contract and make sure you follow through on any obligations you

have as the trainer.

Follow the course design.

So remember, you don't have all the perspectives, all of the needs of the organization, perhaps particularly

if you're just an employee or if you are, you know, hired outside as a contractor.

So whatever they have in the courses, I just assume that it's well thought out.

Just assume that it's there for a reason and don't get too creative by manipulating the courses.

I'd follow it as closely as possible barring extenuating circumstances and don't draw attention to flaws

in education materials.

Right.

So if there's a typo, maybe an incorrect statement, I don't feel the need to to bring it up or, you

know, be apologetic for it in front of the audience.

Maintaining the respect of the organization is important.

So just if you can ignore it, if it's brought up, you know, you can thank the student for bringing

to your attention and let them know that you'll you'll pass on their comments.

But remember, you work for the organization and you want to maintain the respect that the students

have for your employer or for the business relationship that you've attained as a trainer.

!-------------------------------------------

How does this picture make you feel, maybe a little nervous for a lot of people standing in front of

an audience and speaking is a very nerve wracking experience, and you'll have to do it quite a bit

as a technical trainer.

That's why we're going to talk about some oral communication skills, some things that are going to

make you feel more confident and also increase your abilities as a public speaker, which will again

increase the quality of your training.

So don't be afraid of this microphone.

Just step up and start speaking.

First of all, breathing is important when you're speaking, breathing from the diaphragm, not just

the top of your chest, but all the way down in your stomach that enables you to project clearly and

reach the back of the room even if you're using a microphone.

You do still have to project so the people in the back and hear you and that the words are coming out

clearly when you're speaking, push the air from your stomach and that will make sure lots of air is

coming through your vocal cords and you're being very deliberate about your speech.

Diction.

Diction is done with the tip of the tongue and the teeth.

It is the way you move your mouth when you speak.

So make sure you open your mouth wide, perhaps a little wider than normal.

Use your tongue, lips and teeth to speak and you slightly over pronounce when you're public speaking.

So because there's distance from you and the speaker, because you are speaking over the natural noise

of the room and perhaps others that might be speaking at the same time, you do need to get familiar

with with overdoing it with pronunciation a little bit, stopping just before sounding affected or unnatural

your tone.

You can vary the pitch of your voice and the power of your voice, the volume.

If you want to draw people in, you can speak a little slower and then use more power and volume.

When you hit your main points and also the pace of your voice, you want to vary, sometimes speaking

slowly, sometimes speaking quicker.

It really adds some flavor to your delivery and helps people from, you know, falling asleep when you're

speaking.

If you're too monotonous clarity, don't speak above or below the audience.

What I mean by that is don't use vocabulary or a style of speaking that is so elevated that that your

audience won't understand what you're saying, but also don't speak down to them like their children

either.

Just try and strike the sweet spot based on the nature of your audience, articulate clearly and be

succinct.

Don't use too many words.

Once you stated your point, move on.

If there's no questions, I assume everybody understands and move on, especially if you've if you've

already checked for understanding by means of some questions.

Limit the US.

You know, sometimes you might record yourself in front of a camera a couple of times to see how you're

doing with that.

Is it really distracting?

Some are natural, but if you're doing it too much, then it's going to be very distracting to your

audience.

Naturalness means that you speak here like yourself.

Don't try and put on a persona or act like you're somebody that you're not.

But, you know, with consideration to some of the things that we've already spoken about, make sure

that your speech is close to your natural way of speaking as possible.

Be conversational.

You're not being arrogant.

You're not just constantly talking about how awesome you are, the technology or how awesome of a teacher

you are, all of your experience to try and somehow impress the audience.

It's not about that.

You also don't have to be apologetic, like, oh, I'm so sorry.

You know, I don't know this very well.

I'm so sorry.

This is wrong.

No, no, no, don't don't strike that tone either.

But just have a conversation with your audience, professional business conversation, and they'll respond

well to that.

Eye contact is important to really look up from your notes.

Don't just speak from the notes or from the slide, but the way you handle eye contact.

Obviously, if you're speaking to a number of people is that you identify one person.

You make a couple of seconds of eye contact and then you move on before they feel uncomfortable and

you can move on to individuals with your eyes like that.

So strike individual eye contact, stay there for a couple of seconds, move on and sort of dart around

the room like that.

It's a very natural way to do public speaking.

You're not reading from your notes.

You're not just staring at the back of the wall.

Personally, but you're engaging facial expressions are great for that also vary your facial expressions,

be a little bit emotive with your face, helps people follow along, draws them in emotionally to what

you're speaking about so that you can affect their attitude towards the material.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's talk about instructor poise and body language, so as you can see, this young man is very poised,

very confident and assertive, looking in the way that he's dressed and his posture.

So poise is all about presenting with balance and grace.

And this can be hard when you first get started because you are very nervous.

You don't know what you look like when you're teaching.

It'll take some time to really hone it in.

But one way to check yourself is by taking some videos of yourself teaching so it can be really uncomfortable

to watch that at first.

But it's really great because you can start to see what you look like.

And if there's any distracting behaviors or, you know, little mannerisms to make you look less than

poised, less than confident.

There are some questions about this also on the CTT plus exam, things like maybe, you know, twiddling

a pen incessantly throughout the entire course, very distracting.

Or there might be something you do with your hair over and over again.

If you if you do some of those things on the video submission, you might get dinged, too.

So give some attention to that.

Good posture is important.

This helps with the projection of your speech and also gives off confidence and poise.

So to make sure you have good posture, what you can do is try this, preferably when nobody's looking.

But you put your shoulders in your ears and then you push them back and then you drop them naturally.

And that gives you this is good.

Lengthening of your spine is good, solid posture, but you don't look overly stiff clothes and grooming.

We've talked a little bit about this already, but you want to make sure that your clothes are appropriate

to the requirements of the organization that you're teaching in.

Make sure that they're fitting for the industry that you work in.

And, you know, this is just a suggestion, but you might want to dress just slightly more formal than

your audience.

So, you know, a tie and a coat may not be required in the workplace, but if you if you wear something

a little nicer than you do, command respect and it's very clear to everybody who the teacher is.

So give some thought to that.

Gestures are part of body language.

There are two types of gestures.

There are emphatic gestures.

Those are the ones that you really nail in the main point or, you know, bring it, bring attention

to what you're saying.

And they're also descriptive, which show, you know, the size of something or how small it is or shapes

and things like that, the direction that something's going.

So use both of those and get familiar with using your arms.

If you find your arms or pinned to your side when you're teaching, try and loosen up a bit and practice

doing gestures.

You might even mark them in your notes to begin with until they become a little bit more intuitive and

natural and then finally smile.

It's hard to smile when you're nervous.

Agreed.

You might have to kind of paint it on at first, but smiling puts your audience at ease.

It makes you kind of friends and equals right off the bat.

So even before you start speaking, the first thing you can do when you address your audience is look

them in the eye and smile.

And that really breaks the ice, makes you feel confident you'll get some reciprocal smiles back and

you'll be ready to go.

So give attention to your poison body language and you'll give off that mature technical trainer vibe

that you're looking for.

!-------------------------------------------

It's tempting to think that once you've designed a course and put a lot of thought and attention into

it, then you can just deliver it.

But remember, you're not teaching in a vacuum.

You're not just going to press play and it's not set it and forget it.

But you do need to be responding in real time to learner behavior to make sure that you engage them

and you're really meeting the needs of the learners.

So to begin with, you need to command their attention and you may need to say some very explicit statements

about turning phones off.

You might need to be very direct that you'd rather students not be scrolling through social media or

taking unnecessary text messages during class if there are computers out of the workstations that you

don't want there to be any Web surfing throughout the course.

So you may need to state those things directly and set a standard for the classroom.

Also, is your responsibility to maintain interest.

So if you see people drifting, if they're eye contact is fading, you need to read the room and perhaps

vary your style of delivery so that you can gain everyone's attention.

This is when you pull the trigger on one of those backup activities, which is very energetic to kind

of get people wrapped up in the information again.

So keep your pulse on how everyone's feeling and adjust to respond to that learner feedback.

And the whole way through your course, you are not just lecturing, but you are engaging learners.

So you elicit their input.

You have group discussions.

You ask encouraging questions and ask them, you know, to have input on the topic in whatever way they

want.

And this way everybody is involved in the instruction carrying on with this.

You do need to be aware that sometimes questions will get distracting.

So although you do want to put plenty of opportunities for questions and answers so the students can

explore their knowledge, if questions get distracting, you need to be able to divert the attention

away from the distracting learner and back on to the topic at hand.

So you'll find some people ask questions just to be attention seeking, just to like prove that they

know a lot about the technology or the topic that's under discussion.

Or they might be doing it to just be disrespectful to you or kind of to be a class clown or something.

Or they might just be off topic time wasting questions that seem to never end.

So if you get a student like this, you know, you obviously want to answer a few of their questions,

but if it goes on and on, you might need to just kind of firmly but politely say, you know, I'd like

to see what some of the others in the class think.

You know, if you have some of these other questions, maybe we can talk after class about it.

Another suggestion is writing down questions that are not specific to the learning object objectives,

but that you like to answer later.

You can always jot them on the whiteboard or let the students know, you know, I'm writing these down

on a piece of paper for later, so so that when we get to the material that addresses them, I'll be

sure to answer this question.

So that's a way of handling off topic questions.

But don't let your classroom get derailed when good, meaningful questions arise.

Be sure that you're answering them directly and and providing the learner with the information they

need.

So you might need to clarify the question.

If they ask a question, you might repeat it back, in other words, and say so.

You know, if I understand you correctly, you're asking this.

I repeat the question back in different words and you'll get some feedback from them.

Yeah, that was a question I was asking.

And then you can offer more information to answer the question.

So clarifying questions from the audience really assures the learner that they're being heard and assures

you that they are absorbing the information that they need to.

And like we mentioned before, as a reminder, feel free to say, I don't know if you don't know, don't

give bad information.

Don't feel that it makes you any less credible of an instructor.

You can say you don't know.

You can offer to answer later in the course or after class, or you can simply state that it's not relevant

to the course objectives and that you have to move on.

So keep in step with your audience, you know, listen to their feedback, observe their feedback,

make adjustments so that it's not you just teaching, but you're really offering learner focused education.

!-------------------------------------------

I wish I could promise that every one of your learners in every one of your future technical courses

is going to be mature and motivated to learn and focused on the material.

But the reality is that if you do this for any length of time, you will encounter a disruptive learner

behavior as adults, students, you shouldn't have to deal with this too much.

I have a lot of experience, not only with adult students, but with like high school and middle school

aged students.

And you get it quite a bit there.

But as adults, most students are there to learn and they're focused on what's going on.

They might even be paying for the information so they're not likely to misbehave.

But there are times when the learner is not really on board and they have the wrong attitude about the

training.

And so you do need to be prepared for their disruptive behavior.

And if you find yourself in this situation, keep this slide handy and you can refer back to it.

And some of the techniques that we're about to discuss.

Number one, don't take it personally.

As we've already mentioned, you've put a lot of time into being confident and presenting assertively

in the classroom.

So don't let this throw you off kilter.

It's not about you, the quality of your course, your ability to teach your knowledge of the subject.

It's not about that.

It's about the attitude of the learner and something that's going on in their life.

Perhaps that is not allowing them to to harness their focus on the topics at hand.

So don't let it get in your head, but handle it assertively.

So one thing that could happen is that learners will give lengthy, critical comments.

Maybe they keep going on and on about the technology, you know, maybe bugs in the technology or things

that they don't like about the implementation or they would much rather be done this way or that way

in the organization.

You know, one or two of these is OK and understandable.

But if it goes on, you might need to even cut this lecturer off so that in their comments, you know,

they don't take too much class time.

So wait for a pause in their speech and then step in, you know, take that moment that they take a

breath and you can just cut in right there and say thank you, you know, thank you very much for that.

Let's see if someone else has something to say.

So you may need to just hop in there, take that moment of pause and cut them off.

And then if it keeps going on and you've had to do that more than once, talk to them privately at the

break.

They may not even be aware of what they're doing.

You might need to just remind them or make them aware that it could be distracting to the other learners

and it's not appropriate for your class.

Another problem you could run into is chatting with other classmates during a presentation.

So they're in the back of the room and they're chatting off topic or they're talking, having private

conversations, set some ground rules for this at the very beginning, make it clear that, you know,

you're not going to allow it in your classroom.

And if you see it happening, you know, while you're speaking, somebody's talking.

You can't just address it directly right there.

You can't just say, you know, excuse me, miss such and such, mister such and such.

Was there something that you wanted to add and you know that, you know, makes people realize what

they're doing?

They'll stop.

And usually that's all it takes if the whole class is talking and and they're not giving you their attention

or respect.

One way to handle that is to simply stop talking.

That uncomfortable 30 seconds of silence is enough for everybody to realize something's up and to look

back at you and you can use that eye contact to gather everyone's focus back.

You may also have an issue with overt hostility and hopefully this doesn't happen.

But there is a chance, you know, somebody just is absolutely trying to malign you and derail your

cause.

If that's the case, address it unambiguously.

Remember, be firm that it's inappropriate for the class.

Use those words.

This is inappropriate for the class and then talk to them privately at the break.

If it doesn't improve, you do have to ask them to leave.

And if you're part of a larger training organization, you should have support if you ever find yourself

in that situation.

So be prepared.

You won't see too much of this, but make sure you handle it in a way that is professional and that

is, you know, commands dignity and you'll be all right.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, it's time for our Domain three review instructor credibility and communications.

So we started this section by talking about professionalism, remembering that you're a business person,

right?

So no matter what type of organization that you're working for, we always try to fulfill our contractual

obligations, make sure that we're conducting ourselves based on the policies and procedures of the

organization.

And by all means, we want to be an easy to work with.

Right.

That's how we get invited back as technical trainers to teach again.

We also talked about demonstrating confidence and mastery of the subject.

And the key thing to remember is preparation.

Right?

We prepare what we're going to say.

We prepare the space that we're going to teach in.

We even prepare our clothes so that we feel confident in our skin and that we project with professionalism

and assertively in the classroom.

We also learned that connecting with learners early on is important by means of maybe some humor, an

anecdote, an interest, arousing question or statement at the beginning.

To get everybody engaged is important to do before you ask for the attention of the audience.

And then we went into quite a bit of depth on oral communication skills.

You'll remember breathing, articulating how to use gestures and body language while we teach all these

things, take some time to master.

And it's an ongoing process.

But remember, taking some video of yourself can be helpful.

You can look back on what you look like and in time you'll really hone your abilities as a public speaker.

Along with this was poise and body language.

One thing to remember is to limit distracting instructor behavior twiddling pens, playing with your

hair, doing anything else that is going to distract the learners from the material.

We want to limit that sort of behavior.

As an instructor and finally, we talked about responding to learner behavior, so doing our best to

answer questions, clarifying the questions that we get from the audience and then giving the information

that will help them to really comprehend the concept.

And finally, we talked a bit about handling disruptive behavior, how to be assertive and unambiguous

when we have to shut down bad behavior and remembering that we always have the backing of the training

organization as we do this.

So if we remember these things about professionalism, keeping our credibility intact and also communicating

clearly, then we will be successful in our delivery of our technical training course.
