You'll recall from the beginning of this course when we went over the domains of understanding for the

CTT, plus that domain for facilitating group instruction is where the meat of this course lies and

where the majority of the learning objectives of the program are 45 percent.

I think of the score is based on this material.

So we have a lot to cover.

We're going to dive back into some of the topics that we've touched on already, but at greater detail,

particularly, you know, what it's like to teach a course and how to connect with students and make

sure that there's a learner focused classroom environment.

So we'll talk about how to make things learner focused.

We'll talk about questions and different kinds of questions and when and how they can be used in the

teaching atmosphere to create certain goals.

We'll talk about performing a task analysis for technical skills to enable you as an instructor to learn

a new skill and then teach it to somebody else.

Then we talk about a few more learning theories, particularly the social learning theory, how people

learn together in groups and how to facilitate those sorts of activities in the classroom.

And also a little bit more about motivation, providing encouragement, stimulating learners so that

their attitude is involved in a positive and constructive way.

So we've got a lot to cover and domain for.

Let's hop right in.

!-------------------------------------------

One of the fundamental principles of the CT plus body of knowledge is learner centred education, this

concept that the student is the most important person in the classroom and that the learning needs to

be designed around the outcomes that you want for the student.

And this is important so that we have our priorities correct, not only in designing the course, but

also in the way that we deliver it.

So understanding your audience is so important, putting yourself in their shoes, putting yourself

in the seat of the student in your classroom, and then considering what the material looks and feels

like from their perspective.

For example, what is their job role?

How are they going to be utilizing this new information on a day to day basis?

How is it practical for them and think about benefits to the student in their job?

Well, you know, people like technologies when it makes their life easier.

They like it when it makes difficult projects easier and people like it when it makes some money.

So all of these can be real benefits to the learner that you can highlight when you're presenting the

information.

What do they already know?

What experience do they have considering that make sure that you speak appropriately to them, not above

them or beneath them or condescendingly in any way, and then consider their attitude.

Are they there by choice because of a personal interest or are they there by requirement because, you

know, their boss makes them be there?

Are you going to have to stimulate a positive attitude or are they coming with good motivation already?

Give some consideration to that and then adjust in your development and delivery of material.

Why do they care to be there?

Ask yourself that question and put yourself in their shoes.

What is going to make them pay attention?

Also, good communication of the course objectives is important.

When you sit in a new classroom, you're looking around as a student and you're wondering why am I here?

What am I going to learn?

You need to make that abundantly clear.

So by being very upfront, previewing the course objectives and clearly articulating the knowledge,

skills and abilities that the student will leave with is going to draw them in and make sure there's

there's no ambiguity and that everyone's on the same page.

Focus on the use of technology in daily life.

Remember, you're not selling the technology doesn't have to be the best thing in the world.

You don't have to convince them that's the greatest solution to this organizational challenge or to

the future of their careers, etc..

But you are trying to teach them a set of new abilities based on the technology.

Also, you're not selling yourself, so you don't have to spend time convincing them that you're the

most knowledgeable person in the industry about the technology.

You don't need to worry about whether or not they think you're the best public speaker in the world

or that your course is the most interesting in the world.

Those are secondary considerations.

Of course, they benefit your course, but the most important thing is the student, what they're going

to learn, what they're going home with.

And this will help you if you keep this perspective to focus on the skill outcomes.

You know, when the student leaves your course, what are they going to know how to do?

How are you going to match the course material to their real world post classroom life?

And if you keep that perspective in mind, then it will make sure that you're creating coursework,

creating materials, that you're facilitating group instruction and also comporting yourself in a way

that that indicates you have the student in mind and that your priorities are straight.

!-------------------------------------------

Key to Lerner, focused education is engagement, as we spoke about before, you're not giving a lecture.

This is not the dialectic approach where you just stand in front of everybody and deliver information

and hope that they get it.

Know you're engaging the student at every level.

You're challenging their understanding, and you really have to kind of probe a little bit to make sure

the students are getting the main points of what you're teaching to determine their comprehension.

So you do this by asking questions.

And if students give incomplete answers, you press a little bit more to challenge their understanding

to to get them to speak at length so you can get a real pulse on whether they've absorbed the concept

or not.

So questions like this really engage the learner.

And you also leave plenty of room for questions.

You open up the class, you say, are there any questions on this Creag group discussion?

Allow that opportunity for them to be inquisitive about what's going on.

Quizzes are also an excellent opportunity for you to engage your learners and also determine their understanding

at any point during the during the course.

So multiple choice quizzes fill in the blank questions.

Essay questions are a great way to gauge understanding if someone has to write at length about a topic

and really explain it in their own words.

It's very difficult to to pretend that you know something in a long answer question.

So you'll get a good sense of somebody who can articulate the main points and give a step by step discussion

of the technical material by means of a long answer question on a test.

And then true or false quizzes are also available to you, too.

When it comes to the technology, you want it to be interactive.

So this should be fairly clear with the technical course.

But hopefully, you know, if there are hands on elements, you're in a computer lab or you've made

arrangements that people are really getting some some solid interaction and a good solid portion of

your course is centered around the doing of the activity.

And we've mentioned a number of times before.

But it does need to be applicable to the real world.

So don't teach them tools that have nothing to do with their job application, but engage them, ask

them how this new technique or ability will affect them once they finish the course and how they will

use it in their jobs.

All these ways, you know, really get the student engaged.

It gets their mind connected to the material, allow them to get curious, satisfy their curiosity with

good answers to their questions and opportunities to experiment with the technology.

!-------------------------------------------

Questions are one of the most important ways for you to engage your learners rather than just talking

at somebody, when you ask a question, even just a rhetorical question, it stimulates the thinking

of the learner so that they have to recall what they know, process it, analyze it a little bit and

formulate an answer.

It really challenges their learning.

And when you use a question that's posed to your audience or to an individual, it really forces them

to take their learning to the next level.

There are a few different kinds of questions that are referred to by name in the seat plus computer

based exam.

So you need to understand the terms that are used to refer to them and also how to use them in a class.

The first one is an overhead question, and that is a question that is presented to the entire class

and then you will allow anybody who raises their hand to answer.

So, for example, if you're teaching a class on Microsoft Excel, you might ask what feature of Excel

is used to turn data in your spreadsheet into a representational chart?

Who'd like to answer that question?

Right, and you take any volunteers, that's an overhead question.

You also have an overhead direct question and this is presented to the entire class.

But then the answer is requested of a specific student.

So you start the question, OK, class, who can tell me what feature of Excel is used to turn data

in your spreadsheet into a representational chart?

Mr. Jones, could you answer that question for me?

All right, so you ask it to everybody, you stimulate everybody's thinking.

So they're trying to come up with an answer, but then you specifically call out one student that's

called an overhead direct question and then you have open ended questions.

And these require an explanation from the student.

An example of that along the same lines would be who can explain the steps required to turn data in

your spreadsheet into a representational chart or graphic.

Right, so that's like a process flow question, you pose it to the whole class or an individual student,

and then they are required to actually, you know, give a long answer that explains their response.

So those are a few different questions that you can use that really stimulate the learners.

One of the bullets here says get comfortable with silence.

So if you are quick to jump in there when whenever there's a silence, if the students don't know the

answer, if you jump in there and give the correct answer, then you're really not giving them an opportunity

to to challenge their minds.

So get comfortable when you ask a question and there's no answer just to give everybody a few seconds

to to at least try.

You might even have to say, you know, anybody.

Anybody know the answer to that or not?

Not judgmentally, of course, but just didn't we like to answer that?

And then you could restate the question.

Here's the question one more time.

Right.

So you're just giving them some time to come up with an answer and get comfortable with those pauses

in your delivery.

Also, be prepared to answer the question, of course, if you're asking a question and it really is

crickets and nobody knows the answer.

Well, that's an indication that you need to go back and teach something a little more thoroughly.

So be prepared to give a thorough answer to the question, depending on the response of the learners.

And also leave room in your discussions for group conversation.

So you might ask opinion based questions.

You know, which of these features you think you're going to use the most in your day to day work.

And you know, that might give a few people an opportunity to say, oh, I really like this, or I think

this is going to be useful.

And that might generate a question.

You know.

You know, teacher, sir, can you tell me how you use this or that?

So leave plenty of space for those conversations.

You don't want to cut them off because of time.

That's part of the explorative discovery, nature of learning.

So make sure you use plenty of questions to teach.

!-------------------------------------------

When you open up the class to group discussions and questions and engagement, you also open up yourself

to the possibility of disruptive behavior.

We talked about some of these concepts in the previous domain.

Number three, handling disruptive behavior.

But let's just review them.

Remember, don't take it personally.

This isn't about you, your knowledge, your qualifications as a teacher.

This is about a student acting inappropriately and be polite in the way that you handle it, but still

be firm.

So you see the picture there.

Of course, you're not going to literally make that, you know, gesture with your hand.

However, that's just to symbolize the fact that you do need to shut down that kind of behavior so that

it doesn't disrupt the class.

Remember that the student is there with his or her colleagues and is obviously their reputation is involved.

So you never want to embarrass the person, even if they're acting inappropriately because you don't

want to disrupt the class further.

Your goal is to just put an end to the disruptive behavior so that you can get back on track and teach

the learning objectives.

So by all means, be authoritative, be kind, but make sure you don't handle any or you know that you

don't tolerate any nonsense.

And then this is key for the test.

Again, speak privately outside of the class.

Again, things are disruptive if they take the attention of everybody onto what's going on.

So if you can hold off, but then take the opportunity of breaks to address the behavior, one on one

is very effective to let people know that what they're doing is disruptive, distracting other students

and that you'd like for them to stop.

And that's usually all it takes to handle those disruptive behaviors.

!-------------------------------------------

Nowadays, there are some great virtual tools that can engage learners in the virtual classroom.

You don't want somebody just logging into a webinar and then going about their business, doing some

other work, or maybe they're at home and they're distracted.

They just have the laptop off on and they've had play.

No, you want to keep engaging them and making them involved in the course.

So the whiteboard area, if you have the ability to access that as part of your virtual classroom,

is great because it allows you to kind of actively write or draw.

That's very stimulating to the learner.

Perhaps they can even contribute if that's an option and they have that ability to.

The chat window is a great way to take comments.

So if somebody is just having, you know, a question that that is just on their mind as you're speaking,

they have the opportunity to drop it in the chat window.

And then when it comes to the time of the class, when you're asked answering questions, you can go

back to the chat window, make sure you've covered everybody's concerns.

You know, commend the students by name who've submitted the the comments because, of course, that

indicates that they are engaged and that can be some positive peer pressure on the rest of the students

hand.

Raising some tools like Zoome, for example, have that feature where you can raise a digital hand.

And as an instructor, you'll see a little notification and you know, you can address that.

And that's a great way to allow people the opportunity to speak and not feel like they're interrupting

you.

Screen shares are great, too, so you can screen share, but you can also allow the students to screen

share.

So if they're demonstrating something, maybe you have a group activity where it's their their turn

to teach the class a technology, a skill, how to do something.

They can share their screen and go through the steps.

So leave plenty of room for that.

It does not have to be a dry webinar just because you're in the virtual setting.

Pre-recorded video is great, too.

Don't forget that you can just show a video right there, you know, in your virtual classroom.

And that's very stimulating because a lot of movement, a lot of color, a lot of audio.

It's a it's a change of pace.

So make sure to, you know, access those videos.

Sometimes you can find great external providers of good content material, whether it's on YouTube or

some other course.

You have access to their video content.

It breaks it up.

It means that you're not talking the whole time.

You're talking a little bit.

And then you can show a video to kind of reinforce what you've just taught.

That comes from a different source.

And it really directs people's attention and keeps them interested and focused on what you're teaching.

Breakout groups are great, too.

I know Zoom has a great feature for breakout groups now.

So for group activities, you can manage that and monitor that as the host of the meeting, send people

off into their various groups so they can work and then bring them back into the main room when they're,

you know, done with the group activity.

So the point is, whatever platform you're using, really know the tools that will engage the learners

and then use them.

If you're developing a course, you know, specifically know that the virtual classroom tool that you're

using and then implement all its features, because the more interactive your class is, the better

your students will learn.

!-------------------------------------------

As a technical trainer, you may be required to perform a task analysis and a task analysis is when

you take a fairly complex technical ability and you break it down into its subsequent parts, into his

subsequent steps, and you get a clear understanding of how one step leads to the next.

So you can really break down something complex, a subject matter expert or somebody who is very versed

in the technology.

They just perform complex tasks very quickly and they don't break it down into a step by step.

But as a trainer, when you're trying to give these technical demonstrations, you need to understand

how that works.

So task analysis is usually performed.

When you do ahead of time, you will meet with a subject matter expert or somebody who uses the technology

and knows it well, and you will watch them and perhaps perform a side by side with them so that you

thoroughly understand the steps of the technical process.

So there's two forms of observation that you might perform with the subject matter expert, and that

is a passive observation or an act of observation.

So passive observation.

You're just watching this me do their thing and you're maybe taking notes.

You're asking them to do it slowly so that you can jot down every different step.

And an act of observation is when you have the technology open on your interface at the same time and

you are following along as they do it and perhaps taking steps.

Ideally, you want to do both because in the technical classroom you're going to be demonstrating the

technology.

So you need to make sure you know how to do it.

Why not try it a few times there with the subject matter expert?

Make sure you understand the logic of the workflow.

Why did we do this step and then that step and then the other step and be abundantly clear, don't skip

over any little tasks that you think might be, you know, obvious to your learner.

It's not everybody's at a different level of technical ability.

So make sure you break everything down and you can create what is called a hierarchical decomposition

of the skill.

And you'll see this on the right here in the diagram.

So at the top, you have the skill or the outcome.

This is what you need for them to be able to do.

And then you break that down into step one, step two, step three, and starting at the bottom with

the initial state, which is, you know, the very beginning of the technical task.

So going back to, for example, creating charts based on data in an Excel spreadsheet, the initial

state is blank spreadsheet on Excel.

And then the skill outcome is the ability to fill data into the spreadsheet and then turn it into a

representational graphic.

So then what are the steps, you know, you know, individual steps taking you from the initial step

to the outcome.

So you break that down.

You're very specific about all those steps and then you practice it before you teach your course.

And this, you know, hierarchical decomposition.

If you do it yourself and you make it look good with some sort of graphic, as is shown here on the

right, you can actually use that as a handout or something for the class to do.

So if you've done it for yourself, you can teach it and also create some sort of visual aid with it

at the same time.

!-------------------------------------------

In domain for group facilitation, we're going to talk about some educational psychology again now,

we talked about some theories of adult learning in previous sections, but mainly in the context of

designing a course and preparing course materials.

But with Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of educational goals, I want you to view this as sort of a real

time cognitive process that's happening in the minds of learners as you deliver material.

So imagine that you are the technical trainer.

You're standing in front of adult learners, and as you facilitate the education, these mile markers

of comprehension are happening in their mind.

So these are like steps in the acquisition of a new skill or knowledge that will be happening.

And understanding these helps you to deliver the information in a way that touches on each one of those

mileposts to make sure that there's been a thorough and thorough absorption of the new material.

Don't view it like some sort of checklist that you're going to literally have in your hand as a technical

trainer, making sure that you've done them one after another.

It's not like that.

But, you know, understanding conceptually how your learners will learn in real time while you're teaching

helps you to make sure that you're guiding them in a way that is most beneficial for the learner.

So according to Benjamin Bloom, there are three types of or domains of learning goals, the psychomotor

domain, which is like physical motor skills and how students learn those, then there is also the cognitive

domain, which are cognitive events, things that happen in the mind, in the comprehension of new information.

And then we have the effective domain, which is changes that occur in a student's feelings about the

material they are learning or their emotional state.

So let's go back and look at these one at a time.

To begin with, we have the Sicher psychomotor domain again, motor skills, tactile abilities.

So here's how it goes.

Here's how you lead them through these events.

Number one, perception.

This is where a student will simply be watching you perform a task and they will use their senses to

observe what's going on.

Next is the set.

And this is where they kind of get ready to learn the new task.

They kind of prepare themselves to mimic you.

Then there's the guided response and this is where they follow along step by step in the technical function

that you're performing following that is the mechanism step.

And this is kind of where a student takes everything they've seen in perception, also their kind of

readiness to perform the task themselves and then also the step by step function that you just did.

And they put it all together so that they really comprehend how all the steps go together to meet the

desired motor skill goal.

After that, they will be able to perform a complex overresponse.

This means they can do the task by themselves without a step by step guidance.

After that is the adaptation stage.

And this is where they might even be able to modify the tasks slightly to other circumstances.

So maybe you give the students an activity to do where they have to use the same technical skill but

apply to a different challenge or tweak it somehow to solve a problem.

That's the adaptation stage.

And then finally they will enter origination, which is where they understand the skill and they've

mastered it and they can perform it by themselves and they can adapt to new circumstances.

And now they may even enhance upon it, expand the task, experiment with the technology and really

learn some of the ins and outs that will apply to their daily job roles.

So when you're teaching a motor skill, you want to kind of guide it in this order and it will really

help your students to, you know, learn thoroughly.

Psychomotor ptomaine.

OK, let's move to the cognitive domain, OK?

The first step of the cognitive domain is knowledge.

So this is just the ability to recall technical information, vocabulary and concepts.

Also, just like remembering, you know, data in data.

Now, this is what the word means.

This is what the term means.

And the student can just regurgitate, regurgitate a definition.

Beyond knowledge is comprehension, and this is when not just understanding the details, but they also

understand how the details come together and they can really comprehend the technical concept, even

to the point of being able to explain it, then they will apply what they've learned so they understand

the concept and they can now apply it to real life, you know, example or implementation.

In the analysis stage, they will comprehend the cause and effect, how the new knowledge, you know,

brought some sort of effect into the real world.

And in the syntheses section, they will be able to create new solutions and designs based on learning.

So similar to in the psychomotor domain, once somebody really absorbs information, they can start

playing around with it and they can start, you know, handling different kinds of challenges, tweaking

it a bit to meet and solve new problems.

So they do the same thing in the cognitive domain, too.

And then finally in the evaluation stage, they can explain a technical approach to a proposed solution.

So this is kind of building on what they know.

There's a new problem and they can explain how the new knowledge can be used to solve that problem.

That is the cognitive domain.

And then finally, we have the effective domain receiving, responding and valuing, so in the initial

emotional state, they're open to learning, they're receiving, they're paying attention.

Then there's the the the part where they respond.

So they're engaged in participating in the learning.

They're answering questions.

They're formulating answers.

They're involved in the discussion.

And then finally in the valuing stage, they have the ability to apply the information to new and varied

situations.

So, again, not only have they engaged themselves, they're interested.

They're wrapped up in the technical concept, but now they're actually trying to figure out how they

might use it, how they might apply it.

And their kind of their curiosity is piqued to the point that they get a little creative.

So, again, that's a brief overview of Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of educational goals.

Please come back and review this.

You're not tested on these persay in terms of having to know all the different steps on the CTT plus,

but it is good to be familiar with them because you were going to build them conceptually into your

courses and then in real time, make sure you kind of follow this flow and make sure that learners are

meeting these educational goals as you teach.

!-------------------------------------------

In Bindura, social learning theory, it's emphasized that we as humans are social animals, and that

being the case, we actually learn rather well in groups when we have the opportunity to interact with

people.

There is something inherent in social interaction that is very reinforcing for us.

We see people's facial expressions of approval when we do something right.

We see negative facial expressions.

When we do something wrong, we laugh together.

We motivate each other.

And all of these normal human interactions can be harnessed in the classroom to reinforce new learning.

So when you're designing your course and when you're teaching your course, make sure you leave plenty

of opportunity for the social element.

So, you know, perhaps your students already know each other.

So they might be, you know, very well aware.

They work on it on a day to day basis with each other.

And you won't have to do much to kind of facilitate this socialization.

On the other hand, they could be meeting each other for the first time.

If that's the case, it's great to give opportunities for people to talk a little bit about themselves,

connect, have some free time to, you know, talk to each other and socialize.

Now, as a technical trainer that's trying to be authoritative and firm and keep some structure to your

class, it can be a bit unnerving to really release your control and allow the rambunctiousness of some

socializing in your class.

Things will get loud.

People are going to laugh, they're going to move around.

While it could be unnerving for you, it is very important to get people stimulated this way.

So really works some time in your course design that you give people this opportunity to meet each other,

make those bonds.

All of this is going to help them learn.

And in his social learning theory, Bender talked about four things that are reinforced by social learning

attention.

When we work with others unitedly on a task, we have a way of really focusing because we know everybody

else is focusing attention.

Learners absorb what they're very well.

Again, because of this reinforcement, positive and negative reinforcement.

When we tried to perform tasks or explain things, we're going to be corrected and we're going to be

guided by our peers in the learning process.

Reproduction is great.

We're going to actually have to perform something new in front of people at a very small group level

that allows us to get good feedback and to guide each other in the performing of a new task.

And then finally, motivation.

I mean, think about it.

You come and you sit in a class as a student.

Maybe you're with other learners that are there for varying different reasons.

But when you get together and talk about how the material is beneficial and what's going to be good

about learning the new task or the new skill, it helps to sort of increase the motivation of the individual,

which then as an instructor, you can harness to keep people focused throughout the course.

So make sure you're using the social learning theory and you're giving plenty of opportunity for students

to get to know each other, to work through each other, work with each other, give each other feedback

and practice new skills together.

!-------------------------------------------

Group activities really leverage the social learning theory, so make sure you use plenty of them.

We talked about them before in course design, but as a reminder, when you're actually facilitating

the group activities, you're going to have to take a good, strong lead, be clear about the activities,

and then allow some time for the groups to enjoy themselves working together.

So some reminders here.

Remember that these activities are modeled after correct information.

So if you're going to allow students to learn from each other, you need to make sure that they are

doing it correctly as best you can.

So make sure they have good, solid instructions on how to perform the technical task so that they're

not teaching each other incorrectly.

Also, make sure that these are activities that truly require collaboration.

You don't want a group activity where, you know, one student is just watching the other do the task

and then the other is watching the other.

No, but it really ought to be something where they're working in harmony together so that the activity

really involves both people or the entire group at the same time rather than a bunch of people just

sitting around.

They also need to be well designed.

So really gives some thought about what it's going to look like in real time in your classroom.

You might even practice some of the group activities ahead of time.

So if you have that opportunity, you're in a larger organization.

You can steal, you know, a handful of people to just see what it looks like, give them the instructions,

ask them to to perform it and see how it's going to go over so that there's no surprises when you're

in the classroom.

Make sure your instructions are clear and take charge when you start getting people out of the structure

of just listening to a lecture and then things start getting a little high energy.

People are moving around the class.

They're talking to each other, they're laughing, they're getting noisy.

All of that is fine.

But just make sure you take charge so that so that you keep people on topic as best as possible so that

they're following the instructions of the activity.

Design games are great.

Physical activities are great.

There's been some research done on how when our pulse is slightly elevated, we learn very well, particularly

motor tasks and memory things.

So although you don't want people running around in a technical classroom, when you get them standing

and sitting, moving around just a little bit, it can really facilitate learning at a new level and

is a great way to keep people interested in your course.

!-------------------------------------------

Active listening is important as an instructor, so there's passive listening, like when your friend

tries to tell you a story that you've heard 100 times before and there's also active listening where

you are reflecting what somebody is saying to you.

You're trying to help them process something and you're really involved in the conversation.

So how to be an active listener as an instructor while you want to observe body language and feedback,

make sure that you are noticing when people are distracted or when they're looking confused, you can

see the expressions on their face.

All of these are indicators that can help you adjust the way you're delivering your instruction.

Listen to comments and questions.

If somebody has something to say, it may be outside of the order of what you wanted to talk about.

But don't be dismissive of those comments.

You know, if somebody asks a question, which is a legitimate question, you may not have been expecting

it, but still just acknowledge the fact that that your student was interested in what you're talking

about and that they've asked an intelligent question and you don't have to answer it right then and

there.

You can kind of jotted down for later so that you address the question in another time, but at least

acknowledge the fact the students engaged when they make comments that are, you know, maybe slightly

wrong, still encourage them and thank them for their comment, you know, recognize that they are invested

in the program.

And that's really all that you can ask for from from a learner.

Minimal encouragers are when you do things like nod when someone's talking or you say, yeah, OK,

or go on, you know, you actually act like you are listening to the question, which you will be,

but maintaining eye contact, using that body language to encourage the student to keep speaking if

they offer themselves to the group discussion.

Probing is important, so if somebody says something you don't understand or they ask a question that

you don't understand, you know, probe a little bit more.

Did you mean to say this or did you mean to ask this?

Perhaps you could say, if I understand you correctly, you're asking this this in this clarifying the

question, probing for understanding really gives the impression that you care about what the listener

understands and that you want to fill their knowledge gaps.

Paraphrasing, too, is a great skill to wear, you restate a question or comment, in other words,

that indicates that you definitely heard what was being asked of you and just in general attempt to

understand thoroughly.

So give attention to those students, value their contributions to the class.

And if you don't understand, you know, keep asking questions.

It really fosters a, you know, environment of mutual respect in the classroom and it makes sure to

engage all of the students.

!-------------------------------------------

As an instructor, we all like to think that we are clear and unambiguous in our instruction and that

when we explain something, everybody gets it right away.

And the truth of the matter is that that's harder than it seems.

There are a lot of factors involved with a student really understanding something, particularly when

you're dealing with technical concepts, which can be quite complex.

So a couple of things are involved in assessing need for clarification.

No.

One, be open to it.

As an instructor, know that we don't always deliver things so clearly.

The first time we might have done our best to explain something but been a little bit confusing in the

words that we chose to use.

And that's OK.

You can always go back and re-explain yourself in different words, break it down, make sure that everybody

understands it, don't have a once and done approach.

Like I said it once, you should have caught it the first time, but be willing to go back and repeat

things and explain yourself.

Second of all, if you identify that the learners really don't understand what you said, so you might

have asked some questions to just review a topic that you just presented, if they didn't get it, just

acknowledge that you will need to go back and review it.

You might need to spend some extra time in the review phase at the end of that particular module.

To address that, you might have to put it on the back burner and come back to it later.

Or you might just choose to stop right there and say, you know, something went wrong in the initial

discussion of this topic.

Let's go back and break it down again and make sure everybody understands it.

So the idea is to not take it personally.

You're still a good instructor, but if the students don't understand something, you need to assess

that with questions and then you need to go back and teach it again.

Another great tool for this are actual written assessment.

So if you're doing quizzes here and there throughout the course or written assignments, if you notice

that the majority of the class doesn't understand a specific topic and all of them scored poorly in

a specific area, then it gives you an idea that that something went wrong when you initially discussed

it, that you either didn't spend enough time or they didn't get it for one reason or another.

Again, don't blame it on the students.

Don't blame yourself.

Just recognize that something was a disconnect there.

And you need to go back and give a little bit more information.

So as instructors, it is our responsibility to meet those learning objectives.

And we want to make sure that we do everything we can to assess the fact that they've understood it

and to go back and give clarification if necessary.

!-------------------------------------------

You can get some students that really get overwhelmed and frustrated when they're not understanding

something.

I mean, this is an example of a young student, but this poor young man, I was trying to teach him

something.

It was a music class.

He wasn't able to perform it correctly.

And he actually started crying right there in my lessons studio.

And I felt terrible.

But I think what I learned from the experience was that I hadn't provided enough encouragement to let

him know he was doing great and that that he could he could master this.

Just give us some time, just be patient.

So you shouldn't have a problem with adult students crying in front of you.

But as adults still, we do show at times signs of frustration.

And this can look like giving up, like forget it, you know, whatever.

I'm just going to kind of check out for the rest of this course because it's too complicated or it can

look like, you know, real sort of anger or disruptive behavior.

So as a technical and instructor, you are going to do a little bit of mentoring and a little bit of

encouragement.

So remember, you got this right here.

This this man in this picture, he's clutching his head.

He's frustrated, just a little bit of encouragement to say, you know, you're going to get this.

Just let's try it again.

Let me help you out.

Can work wonders be enthusiastic in your teaching.

So saying things like this is very difficult has a way of putting the idea in everyone's minds before

you even get started.

So focus on the positive.

You guys are professionals, career professionals.

You're going to this is a complex task and I know you're going to handle it just fine.

You're going to learn it just fine.

So focus on the positive.

Make sure you maintain interest.

So if somebody is checking out because it's complicated, remind them of their motivation, bring their

attention back in and have them focus on one thing at a time.

And you need to be patient.

Because as a teacher, particularly if we know a technical concept, maybe we've taught it 100 times

before, it is the first time that this individual is seeing it.

So continue to be patient.

Don't expect everybody to to get the new concept or the technical skill with the same proficiency,

with the same speed.

You are going to have some that struggle.

And those are the ones that need a little extra attention.

So dig into your patience and your consideration and help those ones out, offer them some reassurance.

And if some are really lagging behind, you might direct them to some resources outside of class.

So you don't want to hold up the whole class for somebody who's struggling, but rather encourage them,

you know, make sure they don't feel embarrassed and then, you know, you might grab them at the breaks

and give them some extra resources and say, you know, this was difficult for you.

Go ahead and and check this out or that out after class.

So you might have some backup materials, links to outside resources for people that are really struggling.

Don't hold up the rest of the class.

Just be positive and keep moving.

Give people the support that they need.

!-------------------------------------------

Let's dig deeper into the psychology of motivation and how you can harness it as a trainer.

We've talked substantially about focusing on the practical application of the student.

Why are they there?

What is going to touch them and move them to stay focused?

Make sure you identify it may be individual to each learner.

It may be different for a few learners than it is to the other.

Takes some time to get in their heads a bit and know that.

So you can you can weave it into your course.

But let's just go over intrinsic and extrinsic motivators so intrinsic.

Are these real deep personal motivations or like a humanitarian goal, something that really moves somebody

at a deep, deep emotional level?

This could be their family, you know, tying new learning to new job opportunities to higher income,

to providing for one's family and their children.

That's quite deep.

But it but it does also deep in the individual and reminding them, just touching on that can help them

to stay in focus.

The actual technical skill you may be teaching could be related to some sort of humanitarian work.

If you're teaching for a nonprofit, if you are teaching for some sort of social group that, you know,

their work is directly tied to a greater social, political, environmental goal, etc., you know,

even if you're not really on board on that on that larger ideology, you can still use it to motivate

your learners because it is something that is important to them.

Make sure that you touch it, you touch on that.

Then there are the less strong extrinsic motivators, you know, like you got to do this to, you know,

to get your job or to keep your job or to get that bonus or because it's being required by your boss.

They are a little they're not as strong.

They don't motivate as successfully because they're kind of they're not connected to you as an individual

and your deepest emotions.

But they are still important.

I mean, if this training must be done, it must be done to keep your job, et cetera.

And you can remind these, of course, you don't ever want to use fear or a threatening tone, but to

just remind that that it's required and that we've been asked by management to take care of this and,

you know, whatever the that reminder is, can keep it fresh in the minds of the learners throughout

the entire course.

And we do want to do this fairly regularly as a reminder, particularly in very difficult concepts.

And when it comes to motivation to you want to check yourself, you might be teaching something that

is just a technical concept.

And it doesn't mean anything, particularly to you.

It may not be your field of passion, but you do still need to connect to your own motivation as a teacher,

because if you haven't if you're not reminded of why you're there, why you're doing what you're doing,

then it will show in the way that you teach.

So this, you know, why are you teaching?

Is it because you value having a creative job in a technical field?

Is it because you enjoy teaching people and helping them in their career journeys or to be successful?

Is it because you just love the technology?

I love the software.

I love this hardware.

And it's my favorite thing in the world to talk about.

All of those just work marvelously and to remember those when you're having a rough day is really valuable.

Restrain your negative attitudes and comments.

So there are times when we're not feeling it.

Do your best to be mum on those topics that you might be a little bit negative about.

Keep them to a minimum because the rest of the audience is going to model after you.

It can be hard to be enthusiastic about something that you're not particularly tied to, and it can

be hard to maintain too high of enthusiasm throughout the length of a course.

So be modest with this, but recognize that being positive can really have a good impact and be contagious

so that others in the classroom will connect with their motivation and stay focused and absorbed in

the material.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, you finish domain for good job.

Let's do our review again, this was all about group facilitation.

So the actual conducting of a technical class and communicating with learners and leading them through

all those milestones of the educational process.

We talked about learner centered education, putting yourself in the perspective of the student to make

sure that you're designing a course that meets their needs and that you have your priorities straight

there.

We spoke about engaging learners and also using questions to stimulate the thinking and also to give

you a good pulse on whether or not people understand what you're talking about and then changing or

making adjustments in your training accordingly.

We spoke a little bit about performing a task analysis, what it's like to sit with a subject matter

expert and break a complex task into individual subtasks and then create that hierarchical design that

can be used for a handout for your students.

And that's important that we know how to do a task analysis.

And we did a little bit more educational psychology with Bloom's taxonomy of educational goals and also

the social learning theory, how we can weave those into fun and stimulating group activities.

We talked a bit about how to listen well, active listening when students have something to say or a

question, how to assess their understanding by means of the comments that they make.

Encourage them to talk and use that information as you move yourself through your course material.

And finally, we wrapped up with student motivation, tapping into their intrinsic and extrinsic motivators,

reminding them and making sure as a technical trainer that we are motivated to do our best to.

So good job getting through Dumain, for this is when you want to be very familiar with.

Make sure you review it quite a bit before the test and go ahead and move on to the quiz now and I'll

see you in the next section.
