Being able to impart knowledge effectively is an art form.

There's a big difference between being a technical person, maybe being able to perform a technical

task and having the ability to teach a classroom of adult learners and Dumain to draw the distinction

even further.

In this section, we're going to talk about methods and media of instructional delivery.

So in this section, we're going to dive a little bit into educational psychology, for example, talking

about how you can access the motivation of students and develop material in a way that touches their

practical lives and helps them to feel connected to you as an instructor.

We're also going to talk about some theories of adult learning so how people gather new information

and apply it.

And you'll talk about different ways in the classroom to leverage your understanding of the human mind

and how it learns to create effective courses.

And then finally, we're going to talk about different presentation styles, some of the media that

you'll use in class, some of the different styles of teaching that you'll need to use in class.

And you need to have an understanding of this for the CTT plus computer based exam.

But also you will be demonstrating these different methods of delivery in the CTT, plus performance

based video submission.

So let's dive into domain to.
!----------------------------------------------

So here we are, a domain, two methods and media for instructional delivery in this initial slide,

we're going to talk about motivating, engaging and facilitating.

So when you're talking about a group of adult learners, the most important thing is that you tap into

their motivation for being there.

So you have to really put yourself in the shoes of the learner so that you can understand why they're

there, what matters to them, and how the information that you're presenting to them is going to be

practical for them on a day to day basis.

When you understand that you can create course material and ways of presenting methods of instruction

that really tap into the learners reasons for learning.

So you have to know your audience a little bit.

You could be in some sort of academy where you're teaching technical courses to people who are interested

in getting into a career.

So, you know, understanding a little bit about why they want to get in to a career in that in that

field.

For example, my experience comes from technical training with information technology.

So sometimes entry level courses, people are interested in a career change.

They're trying to do something challenging and new, perhaps get a bump in salary.

Perhaps they are trying to make money because they have family members that they're taking care of.

And these are very personal motivators, but they're important for you to keep them in mind when you're

teaching or you may be dealing with career professionals.

So these are, again, people who are perhaps trying to get in a different role in the organization

that they're in.

They're trying to level up in their career for all different kinds of reasons.

And this is individual from student to student.

So you want to understand collectively, generally for the entire class, but then you might even start

to learn over the course of your training about individual students, maybe in questions before and

after class, you start to learn about a little bit about their circumstances and you'll get a good

indication of what's important to them.

And you can keep that in mind when you're creating the course and also when you're choosing the means

of delivering the material.

And then again, the question, how will they use this information?

So what is their specific job role?

How will these specific tasks be implemented in their day to day, understanding that to help you to

highlight the points that are of particular interest to your learners?

So after you've tapped into that motivation, the next task you have is to engage your audience so you're

not just going to give lectures, you know, it's not going to be like a university campus lecture hall,

you know, where the professor stands in front and talks for an hour and a half.

Now, this is a technical training course.

So your goal is to lead the students in the discovery of new knowledge.

So when people go through this process of discovering new information for themselves, that new information

tends to stick in their minds a little bit better.

So your goal is to bring them into the learning process so that they can really attain this understanding

for themselves.

So this means interactive dialogue.

You're not just giving speeches, but you're encouraging questions.

You might do Q&A sessions, allow them to ask questions.

You're going to do open ended questions and get people to think you're going to create hypothetical

situations to help them try to problem solve.

You're going to generate group discussions.

So this means that nobody is just sitting in a chair waiting for the training to end, but they're involved

in the course.

And you're going to need to design your course and plan your course in a way that facilitates that.

And again, finally, when it comes to facilitating learning, we're talking about technical task,

we're talking about tactile abilities.

When you're using new hardware, new software, when you're implementing a new process in an organization.

Students need to have the opportunity to practice it.

So they have to get hands on with the technology.

They're going to learn through doing through performing the new task.

So remember that motivating, engaging and facilitating, you're going to guide the adult learners through

the process of acquiring new understanding.

!-------------------------------------------

Think back for a minute to your history of education, whether it was in high school, college, technical

training programs, gaining certifications, you probably identified certain ways of learning that work

for you.

And they may not work for someone else.

And their ways of learning may not work for you.

But over time, you start to realize that you have a learning style.

And when you are designing and implementing a technical training course, you need to remember this

about the adult learners in your class, that they fall into different categories of learner styles.

And a very common model for identifying learning styles is called the VAK Model Vacay, and that is

an acronym for three learning styles and visual, auditory and kinesthetic.

So this refers to, you know, people who either like to learn with their eyes or those who learn with

their ears or those who learn through touching and doing.

And again, you'll want to have modules in your course that are adapted to each of these learning styles

and not leave one out, but make sure everybody is covered.

So to begin with the visual learners, how do you help them to gain the information?

Well, they're going to do best with like a slide show where they can see the bulleted points very clearly

and they can follow along with their eyes while you're talking.

They're also going to benefit from technical demonstrations where they can watch somebody who's very

skilled perform the technical task.

Visual learners will benefit from that.

Also videos.

So they're going to like I mean, we all like videos, but visual learners in particular are going to

gravitate to that and get a lot of benefit from videos and also written notes.

This could be in the form of a handout that you provide the class.

So visual learners like to have these note sheets or main points perhaps written in a worksheet so they

can take it home and look at it later.

Auditory learners, they learn through listening.

So when you explain technical topics through speech, they're going to benefit from that.

Also group discussions where they hear other people explain the same topic in their own words and questions

and answers.

So auditory learners like to process through dialogue.

So they're going to ask you questions and listen to your answers.

So make sure that you have those features in your course designed to help out the auditory learners.

And then finally, you have the kinesthetic learners.

And these are individuals that really need to get hands on.

They need to do something.

They need to move around.

And that's going to help them to learn.

So guided instruction, perhaps with technical skills, they might be doing a follow along where you

perform the technical task and they do the same thing step by step with you.

Kinesthetic learners will benefit a lot from that exercises and experimentation.

So allowing plenty of time for practice.

So some open ended time in the computer lab where they can play around with the features of the technology

practice.

Doing different activities based on their new learning is going to benefit them a lot.

So remember, when you're building out your course, you want to have a little bit of all of this.

And also in your demonstration for the video submission for the exam, you're going to want to make

sure that you incorporate all of these learning styles and modules in your course to accommodate all

of them.

!-------------------------------------------
Gonyea's theory of instruction is the first of our adult theories of education that we're going to talk

about in this section, so we're really getting into some psychology here, how the human mind goes

about learning new information and what we know about educational psychology can really help you as

a technical trainer to develop a course that harnesses the power of the mind.

Basically, that really works along with the cognitive processes that are involved in learning.

So according to Garnishee, there are five categories of learning or different ways that the human mind

learns, first of all, by taking in verbal information.

So basically using the ears to listen to somebody teach.

When an instructor is giving a presentation explaining the logical steps of a process or talking about

practical value of the information, the student is listening and that is part of their learning process.

There's also intellectual skills.

So this is bringing up old information and connecting it with new information and there are individual

cognitive strategies.

So this varies from individual to individual, but they will have some internal processes that are familiar

to them, which enable them to assimilate and remember new information.

Attitude is also important to learning.

And another factor involved in learning how a student feels about the material, their emotional state,

their emotions surrounding the instructor and the course and the relevance of the material to their

lives.

And finally, motor skills.

So this is in the realm of muscle memory or performing a repeated task over and over and the connection

between actually doing and remembering.

So these are just five different ways that the mind learns.

Now, Gonyea went on to talk about how these can be incorporated into class design, and he did that

by talking about nine steps.

Of introducing new material and of teaching so you can definitely follow this process when you're developing

a course, and if you do so, it really helps to sound down the information in a way that students will

remember.

So let's talk about these nine steps.

First of all, you gain attention.

So gaining attention means, you know, saying something funny up front, having a nice interest, rousing

introduction, making the practical value clear to the student, really drawing them in and making them

want to be there and see why it's important for them to be paying attention.

After that, inform the objectives by means of a syllabus or a clear statement about the learning objectives.

The student needs to understand what they are going to learn in that class.

After that, you want to stimulate the recall of past knowledge, so you might do this with a question

and answer a group discussion, but basically you want to facilitate this process in a student's mind

where they think a little bit about what they already know about the topic because it is connected to

this that you're going to introduce new topics and that is in step four, presenting stimulus material.

So this means that you're now presenting new information that they don't already know.

Following that, you want to provide learning guidance.

So you may provide extra information, case studies, examples, you know, stories, anecdotes, activities,

games.

All of this is guidance towards the learning process that happens after you have introduced it initially.

After that, you want to elicit performance, so this is where you actually have them do the task,

and then as are doing that, you provide feedback.

So you're correcting them as they go.

You're letting them know what they do.

Right.

You're encouraging them when they do something right.

You're correcting them when they do something wrong that's providing feedback.

And then after you've done that, now you need to assess performance.

So this is unguided performance of the new task and this is where you let them perform it or let them

instruct new material.

You let them get through the entire thing and then you assess them on how they've done.

And then finally enhance retention and transfer.

So this is where you basically are reviewing so you can be very strategic about this and place the reviews

spaced out over time.

This helps them, again to bring back the information and then connect it to what they already know

and reiterate the information so they remember it.

So come back and look at this.

When you're designing a course, if you put material in this order, you'll find it very beneficial.

It gives you a framework to work through as a designer and a developer and a teacher.

And it also is very beneficial to the students.

!-------------------------------------------
This charming fellow here is Gene Pidgey, he's a psychologist who also researched the way that the

human mind learns, and he developed a constructivist learning theory.

And again, you can leverage this information in your course design in the way that you implement your

technical training class.

He said that, first of all, a learner will assess the value of the information and connect it with

their goals and daily activities.

So if we said, as we said before, very early in the course, you want to tap into learner motivation

and make sure they understand how the material will connect to their day to day lives and job responsibilities,

then the learner will examine the instruction and create a judgment of the outcome.

So they're going to sit back and think, OK, what am I going to learn and what am I going to be able

to do when this course is finished and they're going to make an assessment of that, and then the learner

will divide tasks into subtasks to realize the desired outcome.

So they're going to say, OK, well, in order for me to be able to do this, you know, new overwhelming

task, I'm going to have to do these smaller tasks to get there.

And that's good to remember when you're dividing up technical tasks and creating step by step workflows,

recognize that this is how the human mind works.

And you want to make those steps very clear and easily digestible.

When you're creating these workflows, then the learner will collaborate with the instructor and fellow

students to experiment with the new learning.

So they're going to take this technical task and they're now going to interact and practice it with

the help of the instructor, with the help of their peers.

So you facilitate this with group activities, challenges and games, group presentations, and also

having plenty of practice time in computer labs and training labs.

And then finally, the learner will use their new knowledge to imagine alternative approaches to the

task.

So this kind of final step of learning is when, you know, a learner feels so confident with new information

that they can actually create new ways of doing it.

So you may present some sort of challenge now that a student has learned a new software or new technology,

you might present them with a problem that they have to use that new learning to solve.

And this is something they could work in the class together at.

But they're learning based on what they already know and really being creative with it to solve a new

problem.

So this is the constructivists learning theory, and you can use that as you design your course and

make sure that you you tap into the way that the human mind learns.

!-------------------------------------------

Now that we've talked a little bit about learning styles and educational psychology, let's talk about

how you can structure your class and apply all these concepts to the different styles of delivery.

First of all, here we have a framework that's kind of like a pared down version of Gonyea's nine steps.

And you can use a simple four step process in the development of any technical class or any technical

class module.

One, preview the material, let the students know what's coming and the learning objectives of the

class.

No, to present or demonstrate the new information or technical task.

Three have an activity so they can practice and sound down the learning and for review what's been learned.

So you can follow this with every module of every class to make sure that, you know, the students

are really getting the most out of the information

presentations.

We talked about this a bit in the course design section, but remember, avoid death by PowerPoint,

break up your slides and have them along with other activities so you don't lose people and become boring.

Get creative with your slides.

You can use different colors and clipart.

It's helpful to use reoccurring stylistic elements.

So, you know, maybe everything under one topic or one domain of understanding will all be the same

color.

That's a good way to guide the learner, along with the logical development of your discussion by means

of your visual aid.

You can also use like an icon every time there's a tip or a trick or every time there's an exam question,

use the similar icon.

It just helps add to the organization of your material.

Remember not to get too creative, so don't use every feature of PowerPoint that can be a little bit

distracting to your audience.

Use dark text on a white background and make sure that your font is no less than twenty four point so

that everybody even in the back can see what you're displaying and remember that you are teaching the

audience.

You're not reading the slide, so keep the words down.

Maybe fifteen words per slide, speak at the audience and then a lot of the slides simply to be a visual

aid for those visual learners.

And if you take a look at the image here in this slide, you'll see that this technical trainer is standing

in the correct position.

He's to the left of the presentation slide.

And the reason that you do this is because that's how we read.

We read from left to right.

So you want your audience to look first at you and then, you know, read the slide after they've looked

at you.

So stand to the left.

You might use a wireless presenter like this.

Those are good because it allows you to move around freely and thumb through your slide deck without

having to bounce back and forth to the laptop.

Next, we have technical demonstrations and this is where you, you know, actually demonstrate the

new tool or technology for your technical class, make sure that you perform a task analysis ahead of

time.

So really break it down.

Remember, we talked about tasks and subtasks really delineate every process of the demonstration.

And you might use this to create a classroom handout so the students can follow along while you're demonstrating

practice before the training session because you want to make sure that you're comfortable doing the

process very slow and speaking your way through it.

You might know how to do this with your eyes closed, but when you're teaching, it has to be slow,

deliberate, and you have to articulate every movement as you perform it.

Another thing to remember is that you need all of the workstations to look similar.

When interfaces look different, you know, maybe somebody's computer screen or software is configured

differently and it looks unlike yours, it can be very distracting and confusing.

The student might think they're doing something wrong or what have you.

So make sure that all of the computers are imaged the same and you have no distractions there.

And finally perform a review so you can perform the task again, perhaps at a slightly faster speed.

Again, speaking through it as you go.

But that second time around can help the learners miss what they say or catch what they missed the first

time.

Group activities are a great way to break up the class.

Here's some examples learn by teaching, so this is where you actually assign a topic for the student

to teach the audience.

And again, we talked about this is one of the last processes in the educational psychology part.

But when somebody can teach information back to the instructor or their classmates, you really know

that they understand it.

So activities that involve learning by teaching are great group presentations.

Along a similar line, you might break people up into teams of three and four and a half of them, demonstrate

a feature of the technology or explain a concept to the class and also game show style activities.

In one technical training institute that I worked at, we used Kahootz and Code is a little game show

style app for your phone, but it also connects to the presentation screen so everybody can pull out

their smartphone and as soon as the question comes on the screen, they have to punch in as you would

on a game show.

So people get up on their feet, gets the blood moving around, gets people engaged and interesting,

and it breaks up the monotony of a technical course.

So you might look into that plenty other ways that you can get creative to implement these group activities.

Keep in mind some things, though, of course, we're going to use these to maintain engagement, you

might want to pair experienced students with the less knowledgeable, great way.

If you have somebody lagging behind, make sure they're in a group with somebody who really knows the

material well, create clear instructions.

You might write them on the whiteboard or print them out on a handout, but make sure activities are

clear so nobody gets lost.

And you want to monitor the groups.

So you're going to move around the classroom, maybe stand behind people at their workstations, check

in on the groups as they're working on the activities to make sure that you maintain engagement the

whole way through.

So those are some group activities and some presentation styles that really incorporates the theories

of learning that we know from educational psychology.

!-------------------------------------------

I wanted to speak with you for a minute about maintaining learner attention, so as we know, people

are in training classes for a lot of different reasons, varying levels of interest and motivation.

But it is still your responsibility as a technical trainer to do your best to keep everybody engaged

and focused on the material.

And so it's important to stay in step with the feedback that you're getting from the learners.

If you start seeing people breaking eye contact, looking a little droopy and disinterested, maybe

checking their watch a lot, you know that they're bored.

So you need to be prepared to switch things off.

As soon as that happens, you might have some high energy activities that you are ready to pull the

trigger on.

As soon as you get this sort of feedback from your audience, be prepared for that.

And as you're designing your course, make sure you have some flexibility.

So depending on the timing of the modules, you can adjust accordingly.

For example, after lunch, a lot of people get tired sometimes.

I've just had a big meal.

Maybe it's warm in the classroom.

So that might be a time that you have a group activity, something where people are up and on their

feet and moving around.

And it's good to remember that we live in an age of short attention spans.

You know, everything needs to catch our interest very quickly in the age of video and high speed Internet

that we live in.

And you can incorporate this in your class design, you'd be surprised, even in a module as quick as

20 minutes, how much can be taught.

And by switching modules and learning styles rapidly, even to the tune of 15, 20 minutes a module,

it really stimulates the mind of the learners.

It keeps them interested.

It keeps them going.

The whole class.

Everyone will be thoroughly engaged.

They might be tired at the end of the day, but you will have covered a lot of ground and you really

will have touched on all the different learning styles.

So, you know, while it is the responsibility of the learner to to really invest in your class, recognize

to your role as a technical trainer to keep things interesting, keep things fun, and maintain an environment

in a classroom that is positive and conducive to learning.

!-------------------------------------------

All right, let's do our domain to review domain two methods and media for instructional delivery.

So we talked a lot about educational psychology in this section, about how humans think and how they

go about learning and how you can incorporate the knowledge of those cognitive processes into your course

design.

So we began by speaking about motivating, engaging and facilitating.

Remember tying the information to the specific motivating factor of the learner?

Why are they there?

Why does this information matter to their job roles and their day to day life?

You can remind them throughout the course to keep them engaged.

And we learn the concept of being a facilitator of new knowledge acquisition.

So the student is learning something new.

They're discovering it by themselves.

And you are facilitating that discovery is the best way for them to retain the information.

Then we talked about the different kinds of learners, right.

The VAC model vacay visual, auditory and kinesthetic learners and making sure that there are modules

in your course that cater to each of these learning styles.

We discussed Gonyea's theory of instruction, those cognitive processes that involve how people assimilate

new information, their attitude, how they use their motor skills to remember and also gain had those

nine steps that we can follow in our course design.

We also talked about Jean Pidgey, the constructivists learning theory, how students assess the value

of the information and break it down into into itemise tasks, practice them with others collaboratively,

and then use new knowledge to create new outcomes.

Feel free to review those theories of adult learning before your test.

We talked a little bit about presentations, how to make presentations interesting and also conducive

to learning for the visual learners so that they're visible and easily understandable for everybody

in the course.

And we also talked about how to do a technical demonstration, how to articulate step by step processes

of, you know, a technical demonstration and how to do it slowly and to review it.

Right.

There were some other suggestions that you might want to go back and look at for group activities,

things like learning by teaching that you might have a student teach the class or or game show style

activities or activities that involve getting up and moving around, you know, anything to break up

the monotony of a course, make it engaging and touch on all the different learning styles in your class.

And finally, we talked about training materials and how to make them aesthetically pleasing, how to,

you know, make sure that they reflect the quality of your course design and particularly in virtual

classrooms.

We talked about ensuring that your materials for instruction work with the platform that you're using

are designed for the platform that you're using and that you know all the features in your virtual classroom

so that you can have learner focused and engaging education.

So that is domain to thank you for your attention.

And please go on now to do the Section two or the Section three quiz below.
