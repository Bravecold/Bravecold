All right, I couldn't let you go without a bonus lecture.

Let's talk about how to get rid of those pre certification test nerves.

It is completely understandable that you are a little anxious before taking both the computer based

test and the video exam.

You're not alone in this.

You have invested considerable time and money into getting this certification and you want to get it

right.

So the first thing to remember is that it's completely understandable that you're nervous.

But there are some things you can do, some little hacks to limit the nerves that you have on test day

number one, prepare the night before.

OK, so make sure you get a full night's sleep the night before you're taking your exam.

If you're taking it in the morning, you know, make sure you've had breakfast.

Don't take the exam on an empty stomach, treat your body well so that you have the rest and the fuel

needed to perform at your best.

Number two, don't be rushed.

So, you know, get to the testing center early so you don't have to worry about getting parking and

all those other things that can get you nervous and flustered.

You might map out the directions ahead of time, even drive to the testing center ahead of time so that

there are no surprises on test day.

The same could be said if you are using Pearson views at home testing solution, which is, you know,

when you have the the proctor watching you, you know, make sure you test your hardware and software

so that there are no issues on the day of your test run.

All that ahead of time and get that stress out of your mind, know what to bring for your test, know

what forms of ID you need.

All of that can be found on comp tag.

Again, you don't want there to be any surprises when you get there for your test.

Now, before you sit down for the computer based test, before you actually hit that record button,

you want to manage some of these physiological stressors.

So the best way to do that is to just take a nice deep breath

and allow yourself to just relax a little bit.

If you're if you're doing the performance based exam, you might move around, you might do some jumping

jacks.

All of this can get your body moving a little bit and just relax you.

And then you want to focus, you know, take a minute before you jump into that first question on the

computer based exam and just, you know, realign yourself.

Remind yourself why you're why, why you are there.

Remind yourself about all the preparation that you've done and just refocus.

And if you get, you know, 30 questions in and you start to get a resurgence of your nerves, you know,

sit back in your chair, take another deep breath and refocus again.

Don't keep answering the questions when you're in a nervous state, but take care of those nerves when

it comes to the performance based exam.

Remember, there is nothing better than preparation.

Another thing that will help you calm your nerves is visualization.

Visualize what it's going to be like to pass that exam, particularly for the performance based.

What's it going to feel like standing in front of the class and really dropping the mic and doing a

great job on this.

What's it going to look like when you've concluded the lecture and you know, you did a great job?

What's it going to feel like?

Visualizing your success can make sure that you are actually successful when it comes down to examination

time.

So just remember that you're not alone.

Test taking anxiety is common even for the most experienced certification test takers.

Keep in mind some of these reminders.

Treat yourself well.

You've done a lot of work here.

Thank you for being part of this class.

And I wish you all the best.
