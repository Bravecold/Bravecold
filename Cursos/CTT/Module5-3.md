Questions are one of the most important ways for you to engage your learners rather than just talking

at somebody, when you ask a question, even just a rhetorical question, it stimulates the thinking

of the learner so that they have to recall what they know, process it, analyze it a little bit and

formulate an answer.

It really challenges their learning.

And when you use a question that's posed to your audience or to an individual, it really forces them

to take their learning to the next level.

There are a few different kinds of questions that are referred to by name in the seat plus computer

based exam.

So you need to understand the terms that are used to refer to them and also how to use them in a class.

The first one is an overhead question, and that is a question that is presented to the entire class

and then you will allow anybody who raises their hand to answer.

So, for example, if you're teaching a class on Microsoft Excel, you might ask what feature of Excel

is used to turn data in your spreadsheet into a representational chart?

Who'd like to answer that question?

Right, and you take any volunteers, that's an overhead question.

You also have an overhead direct question and this is presented to the entire class.

But then the answer is requested of a specific student.

So you start the question, OK, class, who can tell me what feature of Excel is used to turn data

in your spreadsheet into a representational chart?

Mr. Jones, could you answer that question for me?

All right, so you ask it to everybody, you stimulate everybody's thinking.

So they're trying to come up with an answer, but then you specifically call out one student that's

called an overhead direct question and then you have open ended questions.

And these require an explanation from the student.

An example of that along the same lines would be who can explain the steps required to turn data in

your spreadsheet into a representational chart or graphic.

Right, so that's like a process flow question, you pose it to the whole class or an individual student,

and then they are required to actually, you know, give a long answer that explains their response.

So those are a few different questions that you can use that really stimulate the learners.

One of the bullets here says get comfortable with silence.

So if you are quick to jump in there when whenever there's a silence, if the students don't know the

answer, if you jump in there and give the correct answer, then you're really not giving them an opportunity

to to challenge their minds.

So get comfortable when you ask a question and there's no answer just to give everybody a few seconds

to to at least try.

You might even have to say, you know, anybody.

Anybody know the answer to that or not?

Not judgmentally, of course, but just didn't we like to answer that?

And then you could restate the question.

Here's the question one more time.

Right.

So you're just giving them some time to come up with an answer and get comfortable with those pauses

in your delivery.

Also, be prepared to answer the question, of course, if you're asking a question and it really is

crickets and nobody knows the answer.

Well, that's an indication that you need to go back and teach something a little more thoroughly.

So be prepared to give a thorough answer to the question, depending on the response of the learners.

And also leave room in your discussions for group conversation.

So you might ask opinion based questions.

You know, which of these features you think you're going to use the most in your day to day work.

And you know, that might give a few people an opportunity to say, oh, I really like this, or I think

this is going to be useful.

And that might generate a question.

You know.

You know, teacher, sir, can you tell me how you use this or that?

So leave plenty of space for those conversations.

You don't want to cut them off because of time.

That's part of the explorative discovery, nature of learning.

So make sure you use plenty of questions to teach.
